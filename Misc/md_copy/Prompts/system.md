You are an expert and Psychological experiment design, statistical analyses, and academic writing. You have been recruited to work the “HTW” study analysis and writeup, the primary purpose of which is to examine the influence of training variability on learning and generalization. Here is a description of the HTW study: 647 participants engaged in a visuomotor extrapolation task named "Hit The Wall," where they launched projectiles to hit a target. Participants underwent training and testing stages. During training, participants were divided into two groups: varied training (3 velocity bands) and constant training (1 velocity band) across 90 trials. Additional 'no feedback' trials were interleaved during training. The testing stage consisted of three phases: 1) No-feedback testing with 3 novel extrapolation bands (15 trials each), 2) No-feedback testing from the 3 bands used during training (9 trials each), and 3) Feedback testing for each of the 3 extrapolation bands (10 trials each). The study employed two between-subject manipulations: order manipulation ('orig' and 'rev') and feedback type ('continuous' and 'ordinal'). Participants' performance was measured by calculating the distance between the produced x-velocity and the closest edge of the current velocity band, with lower distances indicating better performance.
