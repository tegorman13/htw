  abstract = {Word frequency is an important predictor of word-naming and lexical decision times. It is, however, confounded with contextual diversity, the number of contexts in which a word has been seen. In a study using a normative, corpus-based measure of contextual diversity, word-frequency effects were eliminated when effects of contextual diversity were taken into account (but not vice versa) across three naming and three lexical decision data sets; the same pattern of results was obtained regardless of which of three corpora was used to derive the frequency and contextual-diversity values. The results are incompatible with existing models of visual word recognition, which attribute frequency effects directly to frequency, and are particularly problematic for accounts in which frequency effects reflect learning. We argue that the results reflect the importance of likely need in memory processes, and that the continuity between reading and memory suggests using principles from memory research to inform theories of reading.},

We tested this hypothesis in two experiments, directly comparing the predictive accuracy of an optimal model and plausible suboptimal models. We obtained strong evidence that people deviated from the optimal strategy by excessively avoiding loss regions when the potential loss was zero and failing to shift far enough away from loss regions when potential losses outweighed the potential gains. Although allowing nonlinear distortions of value and probability information improved the fit of value-maximizing models, behavior was best described by a model encapsulating a simple heuristic strategy. This suggests that visuomotor decisions are likely influenced by biases and heuristics observed in more classical economic decision-making tasks.},

We studied the effect of variable training in a novel language on reading trained and untrained words.                                         Method               Sixty typical adults received 2 sessions of training in reading an artificial script. Participants were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: a variable training group practicing a large set of 24 words, and 2 nonvariable training groups practicing a smaller set of 12 words, with twice the number of repetitions per word.                                         Results               Variable training resulted in higher accuracy for both trained and untrained items composed of the same graphemes, compared to the nonvariable training. Moreover, performance on untrained items was correlated with phonemic awareness only for the nonvariable training groups.                                         Conclusions               High stimulus variability increases the reliance on small unit decoding in adults reading in a novel script, which is beneficial for both familiar and novel words. These results show that the statistical properties of the input during reading acquisition influence the type of acquired knowledge and have theoretical and practical implications for planning efficient reading instruction methods.

PSM assigns high similarity to states for which the optimal policies in those states as well as in future states are similar. We also present a contrastive representation learning procedure to embed any state similarity metric, which we instantiate with PSM to obtain policy similarity embeddings (PSEs).

The current study examined the role of object variability for new word learning by preschoolers with specific language impairment (SLI).

Half of the children saw 3 identical objects corresponding to each new word during training (No Variability group); the other half of the children saw 3 different objects corresponding to each new word during training (High Variability group). Children completed vocabulary learning tests for objects seen during training and for new within-category objects that were never seen during training as a test of category generalization. Learning was assessed the day after each training activity, and retention was assessed 3 weeks after the last training session. Results There were no group differences on trained or generalization items immediately following training sessions. However, children in the High Variability group demonstrated significantly better retention 3 weeks after experimental training.

  abstract = {A large number of studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of contextual interference (CI) created by a random practice of different task variations during training on the retention and transfer of motor skills. Current interpretations of this phenomenon assume that random practice engages the subjects in deep and elaborate processing of movement related information, whereas blocked practice results in more superficial processing leading to poorer performance on later retention and transfer tests. According to this line of interpretation, we hypothesised that the complexity of the task to be learned could modulate the effects of CI. If the task is sufficiently complex, it could force the subjects to rely on such elaborate processing, and the beneficial effects of the intertask interference created by random practice could be obscured in that case. We tested this hypothesis by analysing the effects of practice schedule (random vs. blocked), on the acquisition, retention and transfer of learning in a drawing task where subjects had to reproduce accurately, without visual control, geometrical patterns presented on a video screen, as a function of task complexity defined by the number of segments (two, three or four) of each pattern. The results indicated a clear beneficial effect of random over blocked practice on delayed retention and transfer. However, this CI effect was only observed in subjects who learned the simplest movements, and was not observed in subjects who practised the more complex task. These results are discussed in terms of intratask interference created by the planning of multiple movements and the processing of knowledge of results (KR) when the number of drawing movements is increased. These findings support the assumption that the level of cognitive effort in which the subjects are engaged during training is a main factor influencing long-term retention and transfer of motor skills.},

The discovery process involves exploring the environment and developing associations between discontinuities in the task and events that precede them. The growth of associative strength in ACT-R serves to identify potential causal connections. The model can derive operators from these discovered causal relations just as does with the instructed causal information. Subjects were given a task of learning to play a video game either with a description of the game's causal structure (Instruction) or not (Discovery). The Instruction subjects learned faster, but successful Discovery subjects caught up. After 20 3-minute games the behavior of the successful subjects in the two groups was largely indistinguishable. The play of these Discovery subjects jumped in the same discrete way as did the behavior of simulated subjects in the model.

Such modeling has not been suitable for predicting future performance, both in terms of retention and transfer to new tasks. The present study attempted to quantify, by means of a machine learning algorithm, the prediction of skill transfer for three practice conditions in a climbing task: constant practice (without any modifications applied during learning), imposed variable practice (with graded contextual modifications, i.e., the variants of the climbing route), and self-controlled variable practice (participants were given some control over their variant practice schedule). The proposed pipeline allowed us to measure the fitness of the test to the dataset, i.e., the ability of the dataset to be predictive of the skill transfer test. Behavioral data are difficult to model with statistical learning and tend to be 1) scarce (too modest data sample in comparison with the machine learning standards) and 2) flawed (data tend to contain voids in measurements). Despite these adversities, we were nevertheless able to develop a machine learning pipeline for behavioral data. The main findings demonstrate that the level of learning transfer varies, according to the type of practice that the dynamics pertain: we found that the self-controlled condition is more predictive of generalization ability in learners than the constant condition.},

  abstract = {Traditional studies of human categorization often treat the processes of encoding features and cues as peripheral to the question of how stimuli are categorized. However, in domains where the features and cues are less transparent, how information is encoded prior to categorization may constrain our understanding of the architecture of categorization. This is particularly true in speech perception, where acoustic cues to phonological categories are ambiguous and influenced by multiple factors. Here, it is crucial to consider the joint contributions of the information in the input and the categorization architecture. We contrasted accounts that argue for raw acoustic information encoding with accounts that posit that cues are encoded relative to expectations, and investigated how two categorization architectures{\textemdash}exemplar models and back-propagation parallel distributed processing models{\textemdash}deal with each kind of information. Relative encoding, akin to predictive coding, is a form of noise reduction, so it can be expected to improve model accuracy; however, like predictive coding, the use of relative encoding in speech perception by humans is controversial, so results are compared to patterns of human performance, rather than on the basis of overall accuracy. We found that, for both classes of models, in the vast majority of parameter settings, relative cues greatly helped the models approximate human performance. This suggests that expectation-relative processing is a crucial precursor step in phoneme categorization, and that understanding the information content is essential to understanding categorization processes.},

  abstract = {At 14 months, children appear to struggle to apply their fairly well-developed speech perception abilities to learning similar sounding words (e.g., bih/dih; Stager \& Werker, 1997). However, variability in nonphonetic aspects of the training stimuli seems to aid word learning at this age. Extant theories of early word learning cannot account for this benefit of variability. We offer a simple explanation for this range of effects based on associative learning. Simulations suggest that if infants encode both noncontrastive information (e.g., cues to speaker voice) and meaningful linguistic cues (e.g., place of articulation or voicing), then associative learning mechanisms predict these variability effects in early word learning. Crucially, this means that despite the importance of task variables in predicting performance, this body of work shows that phonological categories are still developing at this age, and that the structure of noninformative cues has critical influences on word learning abilities.},

  abstract = {Categorization represents one cognitive ability fundamental to animal behavior. Grouping of elements based on perceptual or semantic features helps to reduce processing resources and facilitates appropriate behavior. Corvids master complex categorization, yet the detailed categorization learning strategies are less well understood. We trained two jackdaws on a delayed match to category paradigm using a novel, artificial stimulus type, RUBubbles. Both birds learned to differentiate between two session-unique categories following two distinct learning protocols. Categories were either introduced via central category prototypes (low variability approach) or using a subset of diverse category exemplars from which diagnostic features had to be identified (high variability approach). In both versions, the stimulus similarity relative to a central category prototype explained categorization performance best. Jackdaws consistently used a central prototype to judge category membership, regardless of whether this prototype was used to introduce distinct categories or had to be inferred from multiple exemplars. Reliance on a category prototype occurred already after experiencing only a few trials with different category exemplars. High stimulus set variability prolonged initial learning but showed no consistent beneficial effect on later generalization performance. High numbers of stimuli, their perceptual similarity, and coherent category structure resulted in a prototype-based strategy, reflecting the most adaptive, efficient, and parsimonious way to represent RUBubble categories. Thus, our birds represent a valuable comparative animal model that permits further study of category representations throughout learning in different regions of a brain producing highly cognitive behavior.},

  abstract = {The exploration of the relationships between behavior and cognitive psychology of game players has gained impetus in recent years because such links provides an opportunity for improving user experiences and optimizing products in the games industry. At the same time, the volume and global scope of digital game telemetry data has opened up new experimental opportunities for studying human behavior at large scales. Prior research has demonstrated that a relation exists between learning rates and performance. Although many factors might contribute to this correlation at least one may be the presence of innate cognitive resources, as demonstrated in recent work relating IQ and performance in a Multi-player Online Battle Arena game. Here, we extend this work by examining the relationship between early learning rate and long term performance using a 400,000 player longitudinal dataset generated by new players of the widely-played MOBA League of Legends. We observed that the learning rate of new players in a competitive season explains a significant amount of variance in the performance at the end of the year. This analysis was then extended by training two multivariate classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for predicting players who by the end of the season would be considered masters (top 0.05\%), based on their performance in the first 10 matches of the same season. Both classifiers performed similarly (ROC AUC 0.888 for Logistic Regression, 0.878 for Random Forest), extending the time frame for skill prediction in games based on a relatively sparse sample of early data. We discuss the implications for these findings based on preexisting psychological studies of learning and intelligence, and close with challenges and direction for future research.},

This phenomenon has been hypothesized to reflect a bottleneck in LTM retrieval processes that forces a strategy choice during an early stage of processing. Here, we investigate simple perceptual{\textendash}motor algorithms that involve no memory retrieval steps, a largely unexplored case in which parallel strategy execution models remain viable. Pronounced strategy interference was again observed, albeit interference that was different in important respects from that observed for LTM retrieval algorithms. It appears that neither parallel nor choice models, as developed to date, are sufficient as a generalized theory of this skill learning phenomenon. Issues central to the development of a more comprehensive theory are discussed.},

Investigating individual differences in face learning can illuminate potential mechanisms and provide greater understanding of why certain individuals might be more efficient face learners. Participants completed two unfamiliar face matching tasks and a learning task in which learning was assessed after viewing 1, 3, 6, and 9 images of to-be-learned identities. Individual differences in the slope of face learning (i.e., increases in sensitivity to identity) were predicted by the ability to discriminate between matched (same-identity) vs. mismatched (different-identity) pairs of wholly unfamiliar faces. A Dual Process Signal Detection model showed that three parameters increased with learning: Familiarity (an unconscious type of memory that varies in strength), recollection-old (conscious recognition of a learned identity), and recollection-new (conscious/confident rejection of novel identities). Good (vs. poor) matchers had higher Recollection-Old scores throughout learning and showed a steeper increase in Recollection-New. We conclude that good matchers are better able to capitalize on exposure to within-person variability in appearance, an effect that is attributable to their conscious memory for both learned and novel faces. These results have applied implications and will inform contemporary and traditional models of face identification.},

Motivated by this phenomenon, we consider when a perfect fit to training data in linear regression is compatible with accurate prediction. We give a characterization of linear regression problems for which the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule has near-optimal prediction accuracy. The characterization is in terms of two notions of the effective rank of the data covariance. It shows that overparameterization is essential for benign overfitting in this setting: the number of directions in parameter space that are unimportant for prediction must significantly exceed the sample size. By studying examples of data covariance properties that this characterization shows are required for benign overfitting, we find an important role for finite-dimensional data: the accuracy of the minimum norm interpolating prediction rule approaches the best possible accuracy for a much narrower range of properties of the data distribution when the data lie in an infinite-dimensional space vs. when the data lie in a finite-dimensional space with dimension that grows faster than the sample size.},

One can distinguish metric MDS (which assumes that the dissimilarity ratings are interval or ratio scaled) from nonmetric MDS (which only assumes an ordinal scale). In our first study, we show that despite its additional assumptions, metric MDS does not necessarily yield better solutions than nonmetric MDS. In this chapter, we furthermore propose to learn a mapping from raw stimuli into the similarity space using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to generalize the similarity space to unseen inputs. In our second study, we show that a linear regression from the activation vectors of a convolutional ANN to similarity spaces obtained by MDS can be successful and that the results are sensitive to the number of dimensions of the similarity space.},

  abstract = {Cognitive models of depression posit that negatively biased self-referent processing and attention have important roles in the disorder. However, depression is a heterogeneous collection of symptoms and all symptoms are unlikely to be associated with these negative cognitive biases. The current study involved 218 community adults whose depression ranged from no symptoms to clinical levels of depression. Random forest machine learning was used to identify the most important depression symptom predictors of each negative cognitive bias. Depression symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory {\textendash} II. Model performance was evaluated using predictive R-squared (Rpred2), the expected variance explained in data not used to train the algorithm, estimated by 10 repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. Using the Self-Referent Encoding Task (SRET), depression symptoms explained 34\% to 45\% of the variance in negative self-referent processing. The symptoms of sadness, self-dislike, pessimism, feelings of punishment, and indecision were most important. Notably, many depression symptoms made virtually no contribution to this prediction. In contrast, for attention bias for sad stimuli, measured with the dot-probe task using behavioral reaction time and eye gaze metrics, no reliable symptom predictors were identified. Findings indicate that a symptom-level approach may provide new insights into which symptoms, if any, are associated with negative cognitive biases in depression., This study finds that many symptoms of depression are not strongly associated with thinking negatively about oneself or attending to negative information. This implies that negative cognitive biases may not be strongly associated with depression per se, but may instead contribute to the maintenance of specific depression symptoms, such as sadness, self-dislike, pessimism, feelings of punishment, and indecision.},

This paper challenges that assumption on theoretical and empirical grounds and presents the Noisy Decision Theory of Signal Detection (ND-TSD). Generalized equations for the isosensitivity function and for measures of discrimination that incorporate criterion variability are derived, and the model's relationship with extant models of decision-making in discrimination tasks is examined. An experiment that evaluates recognition memory for ensembles of word stimuli reveals that criterion noise is not trivial in magnitude and contributes substantially to variance in the slope of the isosensitivity function. We discuss how ND-TSD can help explain a number of current and historical puzzles in recognition memory, including the inconsistent relationship between manipulations of learning and the slope of the isosensitivity function, the lack of invariance of the slope with manipulations of bias or payoffs, the effects of aging on the decision-making process in recognition, and the nature of responding in Remember/Know decision tasks. ND-TSD poses novel and theoretically meaningful constraints on theories of recognition and decision-making more generally, and provides a mechanism for rapprochement between theories of decision-making that employ deterministic response rules and those that postulate probabilistic response rules.},

In this paper, we critically review the class of theories that presume contextual or encoding variability as the sole basis for the advantages of distributed practice, and recommend an alternative approach based on the idea that some study events remind learners of other study events. Encoding variability theory encounters serious challenges in two important phenomena that we review here: superadditivity and nonmonotonicity. The bottleneck in such theories lies in the assumption that mnemonic benefits arise from the increasing independence, rather than interdependence, of study opportunities. The reminding model accounts for many basic results in the literature on distributed practice, readily handles data that are problematic for encoding variability theories, including superadditivity and nonmonotonicity, and provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding the effects of repetition and the effects of associative relationships on memory.},

An important question, therefore, is how the breadth of training affects generalization: does practicing a broad or narrow range of movements lead to better generalization? We address this question with a force field learning experiment. One group adapted while making many reaches in a small region (narrow group), and another group adapted while making reaches in a large region (broad group). Subsequently, both groups were tested for their ability to generalize without visual feedback. Not surprisingly, the narrow group exhibited smaller adaptation errors, yet they did not generalize any better than the broad group. Path errors during generalization were indistinguishable across the two groups, whereas the broad group exhibited reduced terminal errors. These findings indicate that overall, practicing a variety of movements is advantageous for performance during generalization; movement paths are not hindered, and terminal errors are superior. Moreover, the evidence suggests a dissociation between the ability to generalize information about a novel dynamic disturbance, which generalizes narrowly, and the ability to locate the limb accurately in space, which generalizes broadly.},

In children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), very little is known about how skills are transferred from training situations to real life contexts. In this study we examined the influence of two types of practice on transfer of motor skills acquired in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Method One hundred and eleven children with DCD and their typically developing (TD) peers, aged 6{\textendash}10 years (M = 8.0 SD = 1.0) were randomly assigned to either variable (n = 56) or repetitive practice (n = 55). Participants in the repetitive practice played the same exergame (ski slalom) twice weekly for 20 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks, while those in the variable group played 10 different games. Motor skills such as balance tasks (hopping), running and agility tasks, ball skills and functional activities were evaluated before and after 5 weeks of training. Results ANOVA repeated measures indicated that both DCD and TD children demonstrated transfer effects to real life skills with identical and non-identical elements at exactly the same rate, irrespective of the type of practice they were assigned to. Conclusion Based on these findings, we conclude that motor skills acquired in the VR environment, transfers to real world contexts in similar proportions for both TD and DCD children. The type of practice adopted does not seem to influence children's ability to transfer skills acquired in an exergame to life situations but the number of identical elements does.},

  abstract = {Incentive salience attribution can be understood as a psychobiological mechanism ascribing relevance to potentially rewarding objects and actions. Despite being an important component of the motivational process guiding our everyday behaviour its study in naturalistic contexts is not straightforward. Here we propose a methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for approximating latent states produced by this process in situations where large volumes of behavioural data are available but no experimental control is possible. Leveraging knowledge derived from theoretical and computational accounts of incentive salience attribution we designed an ANN for estimating duration and intensity of future interactions between individuals and a series of video games in a large-scale (N {$>$}\,3 {\texttimes} 106) longitudinal dataset. We found video games to be the ideal context for developing such methodology due to their reliance on reward mechanics and their ability to provide ecologically robust behavioural measures at scale. When compared to competing approaches our methodology produces representations that are better suited for predicting the intensity future behaviour and approximating some functional properties of attributed incentive salience. We discuss our findings with reference to the adopted theoretical and computational frameworks and suggest how our methodology could be an initial step for estimating attributed incentive salience in large-scale behavioural studies.},

  abstract = {Many real-world problems have complicated objective functions. To optimize such functions, humans utilize sophisticated sequential decision-making strategies. Many optimization algorithms have also been developed for this same purpose, but how do they compare to humans in terms of both performance and behavior? We try to unravel the general underlying algorithm people may be using while searching for the maximum of an invisible 1D function. Subjects click on a blank screen and are shown the ordinate of the function at each clicked abscissa location. Their task is to find the function's maximum in as few clicks as possible. Subjects win if they get close enough to the maximum location. Analysis over 23 non-maths undergraduates, optimizing 25 functions from different families, shows that humans outperform 24 well-known optimization algorithms. Bayesian Optimization based on Gaussian Processes, which exploit all the x values tried and all the f(x) values obtained so far to pick the next x, predicts human performance and searched locations better. In 6 follow-up controlled experiments over 76 subjects, covering interpolation, extrapolation, and optimization tasks, we further confirm that Gaussian Processes provide a general and unified theoretical account to explain passive and active function learning and search in humans.},

Variable practice is intended as parameter variations of a generalized motor program as well as rehearsal of different motor programs. Although the benefits deriving from variable practice on motor skill retention appear quite robust in laboratory settings, field investigations have produced mixed results. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of different variable schedules on the retention of a complex min tor skill in a physical education setting. 61 elementary school children were assigned Blocked/Nonvariable, Blocked/Variable, Serial/Nonvariable, or Serial/Variable schedules, and practiced two tasks (throwing and hurdle running) and a complex skill (jumping) across 14 lessons. Improved performance in the complex skill was found after practice, with the Serial/Nonvariable group outperforming all other groups. Therefore. the rehearsal of different motor programs was beneficial for jumping skill retention, whereas parameter variation was not.},

  abstract = {The visual system processes visual input in a hierarchical manner in order to extract relevant features that can be used in tasks such as invariant object recognition. Although typically investigated in primates, recent work has shown that rats can be trained in a variety of visual object and shape recognition tasks. These studies did not pinpoint the complexity of the features used by these animals. Many tasks might be solved by using a combination of relatively simple features which tend to be correlated. Alternatively, rats might extract complex features or feature combinations which are nonlinear with respect to those simple features. In the present study, we address this question by starting from a small stimulus set for which one stimulus-response mapping involves a simple linear feature to solve the task while another mapping needs a well-defined nonlinear combination of simpler features related to shape symmetry. We verified computationally that the nonlinear task cannot be trivially solved by a simple V1-model. We show how rats are able to solve the linear feature task but are unable to acquire the nonlinear feature. In contrast, humans are able to use the nonlinear feature and are even faster in uncovering this solution as compared to the linear feature. The implications for the computational capabilities of the rat visual system are discussed.},

  abstract = {The research reported here describes the effects of prior knowledge on how people form categories and learn continuous mappings. Chapter 2 is a review of the past research on knowledge effects in the statistical and psychological literature. Chapter 3 presents simulations of a set of experiments carried out by Heit and Bott (2000) into how knowledge is selected in a category learning task. The model was shown to account for the results of Heit and Bott and generate several new predictions concerning blocking effects with the use of prior knowledge:. ;; 'However, empirical testing of these predictions failed to demonstrate these effects. Chapter 4 describes work testing Delosh, McDaniel and Busemeyer's (1997) model of function learning, the Extrapolation Associative Learning Model (EXAM). Experiments were carried out demonstrating that a model that assumes only linear extrapolation, such as EXAM, is inadequate as a generic model of function learning. An alternative model to EXAM is presented which is constructed of several components, each module applying different quantities of prior knowledge to the task. Chapter 5 presents experiments investigating the extent to which participants abstract and apply functions in transfer-tasks.

Moreover, the size of these online data sets can allow researchers to construct far richer models than would be feasible with smaller in-lab behavioral data. In the current article, we illustrate this potential by evaluating 3 popular psychological models of generalization on 2 web-scale online data sets typically used to build automated recommendation systems. We show that each psychological model can be efficiently implemented at scale and in certain cases can capture trends in human judgments that standard recommendation systems from machine learning miss. We use these results to illustrate the opportunity Internet-scale data sets offer to psychologists and to underscore the importance of using insights from cognitive modeling to supplement the standard predictive-analytic approach taken by many existing machine learning approaches.

Participants were trained on half the concepts under a low-variability condition and half under a high-variability condition. Participants completed a posttest in which they were asked to identify and rate the accuracy of novel and trained visual representations of the concepts. We performed separate repeated measures analyses of variance to examine the accuracy of identification and ratings.

Here we studied age differences in concept formation in a category-learning paradigm with face-blend stimuli, using several metrics: direct learning of category members presented during training, generalisation of category labels to new examples, and shifts in perceived similarity between category members that often follow category learning. We found that older adults were impaired in direct learning of training examples, but that there was no significant age deficit in generalisation once we accounted for the deficit in direct learning. We also found that category learning affected the perceived similarity between members of the same versus opposing categories, and age did not significantly moderate this effect. Lastly, we compared traditional category learning to categorisation after a learning task in which a category label (shared last name) was presented alongside stimulus-specific information (unique first names that individuated category members). We found that simultaneously learning stimulus-specific and category information resulted in decreased category learning, and that this decrement was apparent in both age groups.},

Category-learning paradigms have long been used to understand the mechanisms of knowledge generalization. In the present study, we tested the conditions that promote formation of new concepts. Participants underwent one of six training conditions that differed in the number of examples per category (set size) and their relative similarity to the category average (set coherence). Performance metrics included rates of category learning, ability to generalize categories to new items of varying similarity to prototypes, and recognition memory for individual examples. In categorization, high set coherence led to faster learning and better generalization, while set size had little effect. Recognition did not differ reliably among conditions. We also tested the nature of memory representations used for categorization and recognition decisions using quantitative prototype and exemplar models fit to behavioral responses. Prototype models posit abstract category representations based on the category's central tendency, whereas exemplar models posit that categories are represented by individual category members. Prototype strategy use during categorization increased with increasing set coherence, suggesting that coherent training sets facilitate extraction of commonalities within a category. We conclude that learning from a coherent set of examples is an efficient means of forming abstract knowledge that generalizes broadly.},

  abstract = {When we have learned a motor skill, such as cycling or ice- skating, we can rapidly generalize to novel tasks, such as motorcycling or rollerblading [1{\textendash}8]. Such facilitation of learning could arise through two distinct mechanisms by which the motor system might adjust its control parameters. First, fast learning could simply be a consequence of the proximity of the original and final settings of the control parameters. Second, by structural learning [9{\textendash}14], the motor system could constrain the parameter adjustments to conform to the control parameters' covariance structure. Thus, facilitation of learning would rely on the novel task parameters' lying on the structure of a lower-dimensional subspace that can be explored more efficiently. To test between these two hypotheses, we exposed subjects to randomly varying visuomotor tasks of fixed structure. Although such randomly varying tasks are thought to prevent learning, we show that when subsequently pre- sented with novel tasks, subjects exhibit three key features of structural learning: facilitated learning of tasks with the same structure, strong reduction in interference normally observed when switching between tasks that require oppo- site control strategies, and preferential exploration along the learned structure. These results suggest that skill gener- alization relies on task variation and structural learning.},

From a computational point of view such an extraction of invariants can be regarded as learning of an underlying structure. Here we review the evidence for structure learning as a `learning to learn' mechanism, especially in sensorimotor control where the motor system has to adapt to variable environments. We review studies demonstrating that common features of variable environments are extracted during sensorimotor learning and exploited for efficient adaptation in novel tasks. We conclude that structure learning plays a fundamental role in skill learning and may underlie the unsurpassed flexibility and adaptability of the motor system.},

  abstract = {Actions can be planned in either an intrinsic (body-based) reference frame or an extrinsic (world-based) frame, and understanding how the internal representations associated with these frames contribute to the learning of motor actions is a key issue in motor control. We studied the internal representation of this learning in human subjects by analyzing generalization patterns across an array of different movement directions and workspaces after training a visuomotor rotation in a single movement direction in one workspace. This provided a dense sampling of the generalization function across intrinsic and extrinsic reference frames, which allowed us to dissociate intrinsic and extrinsic representations and determine the manner in which they contributed to the motor memory for a trained action. A first experiment showed that the generalization pattern reflected a memory that was intermediate between intrinsic and extrinsic representations. A second experiment showed that this intermediate representation could not arise from separate intrinsic and extrinsic learning. Instead, we find that the representation of learning is based on a gain-field combination of local representations in intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates. This gain-field representation generalizes between actions by effectively computing similarity based on the (Mahalanobis) distance across intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates and is in line with neural recordings showing mixed intrinsic-extrinsic representations in motor and parietal cortices.},

The results were consistent with a hypothesis sampling theory, and the relative frequencies of four basic hypotheses could be predicted from earlier results with respect to the relative strengths of those hypotheses. The results also showed that the correlation between the hypotheses stated by the subjects and the rules extracted from their judgments by means of polynomial regression was higher for linear hypotheses than for nonlinear hypotheses. The correlation was quite low, however, also for linear hypotheses.},

  abstract = {A hypothesis-testing model was developed to account for the effects of the form of the function relating criterion to cue values in cue probability learning (CPL) tasks. This model is built on the assumption that the subjects have a hierarchy of hypotheses about functional relations between scaled variables, and that they sample hypotheses from the hierarchy according to their strength when learning a CPL task. The model was tested in five experiments. The first three experiments were designed to measure the relative strengths of four specified hypotheses about functional relations by means of estimation and production, and showed that a positive linear function is more available than a negative linear function, which, in turn, is more available than an inversely U-shaped function. A U-shaped function is the least available function. The results of the fourth experiment, which compared rates of learning for the four functions, showed that the relative rates of learning were consistent with what could be predicted on the basis of the relative strengths of the four hypotheses. In the fift experiment, finally, the subjects' hypothesis testing behavior was studied by means of verbal reports. The results of this experiment showed that the subjects tested the hypotheses in the order predicted by the hierarchy.},

A seminal study by Logan, Lively and Pisoni (1991) established the effectiveness of phonetic training for improving non-native speech perception: Japanese learners of English were trained to perceive /r/-/l/ using minimal pairs over 15 training sessions. A pre/post-test design established learning and generalisation. In a follow-up study, Lively, Logan and Pisoni (1993) presented further evidence which suggested that talker variability in training stimuli was crucial in leading to greater generalisation. These findings have been very influential and ``high variability phonetic training'' is now a standard methodology in the field. However, while the general benefit of phonetic training is well replicated, the evidence for an advantage of high over lower variability training remains mixed. In a large-scale replication of the original studies using updated statistical analyses we test whether learners generalise more after phonetic training using multiple talkers over a single talker. We find that listeners learn in both multiple and single talker conditions. However, in training, we find no difference in how well listeners learn for high vs low variability training. When comparing generalisation to novel talkers after training in relation to pre-training accuracy, we find ambiguous evidence for a high-variability benefit over low-variability training: This means that if a high-variability benefit exists, the effect is much smaller than originally thought, such that it cannot be detected in our sample of 166 listeners.},

This advantage in a single action over others in the class is presumed to result from large amounts of practice performing the specific action (Keetch, Schmidt, Lee, \& Young, 2005). In an experiment involving the learning of a basketball set shot, practice was manipulated to identify whether an especial skill effect emerges at the free-throw line as a result of constant practice conditions in novice performers. After a pretest, which involved set shots across five distances, participants were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups. A constant practice group (n=10) performed 300 trials of the set shot at the 15ft free throw line only, whereas a variable practice group (n=10) performed 300 trials across five distances. Shot accuracy increased for both groups as a result of practice at the 15{$\prime$} distance. However, on the posttest, a significant difference was reported between actual and expected scores for the constant practice group only. This finding provided evidence that an effect similar to that seen for especial skills emerges as a result of constant practice. Although an especial skill effect could result from massive amounts of practice, we show it can emerge as a result of short term repetitive practice, indicating that the type, rather than amount, of practice is important.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose that the conventional dichotomy between exemplar-based and prototype-based models of concept learning is helpfully viewed as an instance of what is known in the statistical learning literature as the bias/variance tradeoff. The bias/variance tradeoff can be thought of as a sliding scale that modulates how closely any learning procedure adheres to its training data. At one end of the scale (high variance), models can entertain very complex hypotheses, allowing them to fit a wide variety of data very closely{\textemdash}but as a result can generalize poorly, a phenomenon called overfitting. At the other end of the scale (high bias), models make relatively simple and inflexible assumptions, and as a result may fit the data poorly, called underfitting. Exemplar and prototype models of category formation are at opposite ends of this scale: prototype models are highly biased, in that they assume a simple, standard conceptual form (the prototype), while exemplar models have very little bias but high variance, allowing them to fit virtually any combination of training data. We investigated human learners' position on this spectrum by confronting them with category structures at variable levels of intrinsic complexity, ranging from simple prototype-like categories to much more complex multimodal ones. The results show that human learners adopt an intermediate point on the bias/variance continuum, inconsistent with either of the poles occupied by most conventional approaches. We present a simple model that adjusts (regularizes) the complexity of its hypotheses in order to suit the training data, which fits the experimental data better than representative exemplar and prototype models.},

When the rank order of cue validities was congruent with their salience hierarchy, people predominantly used a noncompensatory take-the-best strategy (TTB) based on the most valid cue whereas they used more compensatory strategies when hierarchies were incongruent (i.e. the least valid cue was most salient). Given the recent replication crisis in psychology and methodological shortcomings of the original study, a better-controlled replication with new stimuli and a larger sample was conducted. A pilot study established a visual salience hierarchy of the cues used. The main experiment clearly replicated the salience effect at the strategy selection level and the longer response times for compensatory strategies compared to TTB. A response time interaction of strategy and condition did not replicate.},

The outcome is a reduction in cognitive load and a greater residual capacity to undertake concurrent tasks. The present study was designed to examine the relationship between cue utilisation and temporal pattern recognition in the context of a simulated, rail control task. Sixty-one university students undertook an assessment of cue utilisation and engaged in a rail control simulation. The appearance and movement of trains followed a consistent but implicit (undisclosed) pattern. Throughout the second half of the rail task, a secondary task was included. The results indicated that participants with relatively higher cue utilisation were more likely to identify the implicit pattern of rail movements, were more accurate and responded more rapidly under increased workload conditions. The results suggest that a propensity to identify patterns as cues may provide an opportunity to reduce cognitive demands, thereby facilitating performance in a novel task. Implications for selection and system design are discussed.},

It is equally plausible, however, that people are biased to make Y-estimates similar to the presented X-value. To differentiate these 2 explanations, 135 participants extrapolated positive linear functions with a y-intercept either greater than or less than zero. In line with the anchoring hypothesis, participants underestimated in the lower extrapolation region when the y-intercept was positive, but overestimated when the y-intercept was negative. These results are consistent with a version of the extrapolation association model (EXAM; Delosh, Busemeyer, \& McDaniel, 1997), which proposes that people interpolate linearly between the training exemplars and zero in the lower extrapolation region.},

According to local theories of shape learning, organisms encode the local geometric features of the environment that signal a goal location. In contrast, global theories of shape learning suggest that organisms encode the overall shape of the environment. There is, however, a surprising lack of evidence to support this latter claim, despite the fact that common behaviours seem to require encoding of the global-shape of an environment. We tested one such behaviour in 5 experiments, in which human participants were trained to navigate to a hidden goal on one side of a virtual arena (e.g. the inside) before being required to find the same point on the alternative side (e.g. the outside). Participants navigated to the appropriate goal location, both when inside and outside the virtual arena, but only when the shape of the arena remained the same between training and test (Experiments 1a and 1b). When the arena shape was transformed between these stages, participants were lost (Experiments 2a and 2b). When training and testing was conducted on the outside of two different-shaped arenas that shared local geometric cues participants once again explored the appropriate goal location (Experiment 3). These results provide core evidence that humans encode a global representation of the overall shape of the environments in, or around, which they navigate.},

The new paradigm utilizes a stimulus{\textendash}response{\textendash}feedback task in which subjects learn trial by trial how a multivariate set of inputs maps into a multivariate set of outputs. The first two experiments use evidence based on a principal component analysis to replicate the finding that intervening-concept learning occurs spontaneously, but only in environments that contain an intervening factor. The next experiment provides a second converging line of evidence for this conclusion by showing that subjects can use an intervening concept to make accurate inferences to a new fourth output during a transfer test. The last experiment provides a third line of evidence by showing that subjects can use an intervening concept to make accurate inferences from a new fourth input. The results are explained by a hidden-unit connectionist learning mechanism that includes both accuracy and parsimony as learning objectives},

  abstract = {Before making any serious decision, we normally try to anticipate how the effects of our action will vary depending on the action taken. For example, before an anaesthetist can decide the amount of anaesthetic to administer to a patient, she needs to predict how the analgesic effect will vary as a function of the amount injected. Before a father can decide the amount of money to invest in his son's college education, he needs to predict how the return will vary as a function of the size of the investment. The point is that prediction is essential to decision making. Predictions are thought to be based on knowledge of the functional relation between the strength of a cause and the magnitude of an effect. For this reason, there is a large body of empirical research by decision scientists investigating how people learn functional relations (Slovic\& Lichtenstein 1971, Klayman 1988). Much of this research, however, has been not been synthesized and integrated into coherent theory, and so this literature remains disconnected from mainstream cognitive psychology. From a cognitive perspective, functions can be viewed as abstract concepts that summarize cause-effect relationships. Cognitive psychologists have made great progress developing theories of how people learn abstract concepts (see Estes 1994). However, most of this theoretical effort has been restricted to one simple type of concept learning task called categorization. It is unclear whether or not theories of category learning can be extended for application to function leerning. The purpose of this chapter is to develop a concept learning model that can account for results from both categorization and function learning tasks. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows: Section II discusses similarities and differences between category- and function-learning tasks, Section III synthesizes some basic findings on function-learning, Section IV describes an artificial neural network model of category learning and extends this model to function learning, and Section V shows how the extended model reproduces the basic findings from function learning.},

Participants were tasked with repeatedly choosing policies (e.g., increase vs. decrease border security funding) in order to maximize the economic output of an imaginary country and inferred the influence of the policies on the economy. The task was challenging and ambiguous, allowing participants to interpret the relations between the policies and the economy in multiple ways. In three studies, we found evidence of motivated reasoning despite financial incentives for accuracy. For example, participants who believed that border security funding should be increased were more likely to conclude that increasing border security funding actually caused a better economy in the task. In Study 2, we hypothesized that having neutral preferences (e.g., preferring neither increased nor decreased spending on border security) would lead to more accurate assessments overall, compared to having a strong initial preference; however, we did not find evidence for such an effect. In Study 3, we tested whether providing participants with possible functional forms of the policies (e.g., the policy takes some time to work or initially has a negative influence but eventually a positive influence) would lead to a smaller influence of motivated reasoning but found little evidence for this effect. This research advances the field of causal learning by studying the role of prior preferences, and in doing so, integrates the fields of causal learning and motivated reasoning using a novel explore-exploit task.},

The topic is relevant in black-box optimization where information about the objective and/or constraints is not available and must be learned through function evaluations. In this paper, we focus on the relation between the behaviour of humans searching for the maximum and the probabilistic model used in Bayesian optimization. As surrogate models of the unknown function, both Gaussian processes and random forest have been considered: the Bayesian learning paradigm is central in the development of active learning approaches balancing exploration/exploitation in uncertain conditions towards effective generalization in large decision spaces. In this paper, we analyse experimentally how Bayesian optimization compares to humans searching for the maximum of an unknown 2D function. A set of controlled experiments with 60 subjects, using both surrogate models, confirm that Bayesian optimization provides a general model to represent individual patterns of active learning in humans.},

A key observation, motivating this line of research, is the awareness that human learners are amazingly fast and effective at adapting to unfamiliar environments and incorporating upcoming knowledge: this is an intriguing behaviour for cognitive sciences as well as an important challenge for Machine Learning. The target problem considered is active learning in a black-box optimization task and more specifically how the exploration/exploitation dilemma can be modelled within Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization framework, which is in turn based on uncertainty quantification. The main contribution is to analyse humans' decisions with respect to Pareto rationality where the two objectives are improvement expected and uncertainty quantification. According to this Pareto rationality model, if a decision set contains a Pareto efficient (dominant) strategy, a rational decision maker should always select the dominant strategy over its dominated alternatives. The distance from the Pareto frontier determines whether a choice is (Pareto) rational (i.e., lays on the frontier) or is associated to "exasperate" exploration. However, since the uncertainty is one of the two objectives defining the Pareto frontier, we have investigated three different uncertainty quantification measures and selected the one resulting more compliant with the Pareto rationality model proposed. The key result is an analytical framework to characterize how deviations from "rationality" depend on uncertainty quantifications and the evolution of the reward seeking process.},

Here we investigated the long-term learning mechanisms that lead to the highly efficient STM-search performance observed under conditions of consistent-mapping (CM) training, in which targets and foils never switch roles across trials. In item-response learning, subjects learn long-term mappings between individual items and target versus foil responses. In category learning, subjects learn high-level codes corresponding to separate sets of items and learn to attach old versus new responses to these category codes. To distinguish between these 2 forms of learning, we tested subjects in categorized varied mapping (CV) conditions: There were 2 distinct categories of items, but the assignment of categories to target versus foil responses varied across trials. In cases involving arbitrary categories, CV performance closely resembled standard varied-mapping performance without categories and departed dramatically from CM performance, supporting the item-response-learning hypothesis. In cases involving prelearned categories, CV performance resembled CM performance, as long as there was sufficient practice or steps taken to reduce trial-to-trial category-switching costs. This pattern of results supports the category-coding hypothesis for sufficiently well-learned categories. Thus, item-response learning occurs rapidly and is used early in CM training; category learning is much slower but is eventually adopted and is used to increase the efficiency of search beyond that available from item-response learning.},

Recent evidence suggests that motor variability may have different effects on learning in redundant tasks, depending on whether it is present in the task space (where it affects task performance) or in the null space (where it has no effect on task performance). We examined the effect of directly introducing null and task space variability using a manipulandum during the learning of a motor task. Participants learned a bimanual shuffleboard task for 2 days, where their goal was to slide a virtual puck as close as possible toward a target. Critically, the distance traveled by the puck was determined by the sum of the left- and right-hand velocities, which meant that there was redundancy in the task. Participants were divided into five groups, based on both the dimension in which the variability was introduced and the amount of variability that was introduced during training. Results showed that although all groups were able to reduce error with practice, learning was affected more by the amount of variability introduced rather than the dimension in which variability was introduced. Specifically, groups with higher movement variability during practice showed larger errors at the end of practice compared with groups that had low variability during learning. These results suggest that although introducing variability can increase exploration of new solutions, this may adversely affect the ability to retain the learned solution.},

  abstract = {A general model was proposed in which it was assumed that, in learning situations involving scaled stimuli and responses, subjects will tend to establish continuous functional relations between stimuli and responses. In particular, it was assumed that each subject has available a general ``functional form'' dependent only on certain parameters (pi), and that in learning the subject effectively assigns specific values to these parameters, thus establishing a specific function defining a unique mapping of stimuli into responses. In the specialized case of the model, the more restrictive assumption is made that the general form is constituted of linear combinations of more basic functions, so that the parameters (pi) may be identified with the weights assigned to each of these primitive functions in establishing a particular stimulus-response mapping. This ``specialized'' model was assumed throughout the present study. Three hypotheses were derived from the postulates of the proposed model, and an experimental study was undertaken designed to test these hypotheses, as well as to answer a number of related questions. The hypotheses were: Subjects will reproduce responses which bear a continuous relation to stimuli (according to an index proposed as an operational measure of continuity) even when the stimulus-response pairs they are given to learn are randomly related. A set of stimulus-response connections related by a continuous function will be learned more efficiently than a randomly related set. A secondary hypothesis was that ``simple'' functional relations (defined by few parameters) will be learned more effectively than more ``complex'' functions (defined by a greater number of parameters). Subjects will respond to stimuli to which no response has been explicitly associated in learning by interpolating or extrapolating the functional relation to these stimuli. The experimental paradigm used consisted of a paired associates task involving 26 scaled stimuli (``V'' marks varying along the length of a narrow rectangle), only 15 of which were used in the learning phase of each trial, the remaining 11 being included in the reproduction phase to allow observation of interpolation and extrapolation effects. Six conditions were used, in three of which the response (a vertical mark on a line below the rectangular slot) was related to the stimulus according to a simple continuous function (linear in two cases, quadratic in the third), while in the other three conditions stimuli and responses were randomly related. All three hypotheses outlined above were verified. In addition, an analytic technique utilizing Fisher's method of orthogonal polynomials was applied, enabling determination of which polynomials significantly related to mean responses (averaged over six trials), and of which polynomials exhibited significant trial to trial variation in slope. It was found that the first four orthogonal polynomials were sufficient to account for most of the reliable variance in mean responses. Trial to trial variance was slight, but significantly present, while tending to be somewhat more heavily concentrated in the higher degree polynomials. The residual variance in the means, once significantly fitting polynomials were extracted, was generally non-significant, and no evidence was found that the residuals tended to represent discrete ``correction'' toward the veridical S-R pairings. The data were subjected to an Eckart-Young analysis with a rotation aimed at finding continuous structure. Three factors were found, very nearly identical with the first three orthogonal polynomials, but bearing a slightly closer resemblance to sinusoidal curves of varying frequency. These accounted for about 88\% of the variance in the mean responses, a fact taken as supporting the adequacy of the ``specialized'' model.},

However, the questions of how the category structure influences this advantage and how simultaneous presentation interacts with the advantage are open issues. In this article, we present three experiments. The first experiment indicates that the advantage of interleaved over blocked study is modulated by the structure of the categories being studied. More specifically, interleaved study results in better generalization for categories with high within- and between-category similarity, whereas blocked presentation results in better generalization for categories with low within- and between-category similarity. In Experiment 2, we present evidence that when presented simultaneously, between-category comparisons (interleaved presentation) result in a performance advantage for high-similarity categories, but no differences were found for low-similarity categories. In Experiment 3, we directly compared simultaneous and successive presentation of low-similarity categories. We again found an overall benefit for blocked study with these categories. Overall, these results are consistent with the proposal that interleaving emphasizes differences between categories, whereas blocking emphasizes the discovery of commonalities among objects within the same category.},

  abstract = {In this article, we leverage data from over 1,000 students participating in two different online courses to investigate whether better learning outcomes are associated with student decisions to practice instead of (re-)reading. Consistent with laboratory and classroom findings, we find that students' decisions to practice are related to better learning outcomes. Moreover, we find that this benefit is particularly related to increasing the number of different practice activities completed and not repeating the same activity multiple times. Our findings are consistent with theories suggesting that practice testing improves learning by enhancing encoding promoted by practicing the same content with different problems and raise questions regarding the benefits of repeatedly practicing the same question. The work presented here also demonstrates one way we can leverage data from naturally occurring data sets and learning analytics approaches to inform theoretical developments and the understanding of cognitive phenomena. We argue that to fully understand the cognitive processes involved in learning we need to test our hypotheses in natural educational contexts, both using controlled experimentation and analyses of naturally occurring data.

First, word-context co-occurrence counts were collected using corpora of transcribed English child-directed speech. Then, an unsupervised k-nearest neighbor algorithm was used to categorize words into lexical categories. The categorization outcome was regressed over three main distributional predictors computed for each word, including frequency, contextual diversity, and average conditional probability given all the co-occurring contexts. Results show that both contextual diversity and frequency have a positive effect while the average conditional probability has a negative effect. This indicates that words are easier to categorize in the face of uncertainty: categorization works best for words which are frequent, diverse, and hard to predict given the co-occurring contexts. This shows how, in order for the learner to see an opportunity to form a category, there needs to be a certain degree of uncertainty in the co-occurrence pattern.},

In an open task-study the novel response was within the range of responses previously experienced by subjects. The present study using an open task concerned whether acquisition of novel responses outside the range of the subjects' past experience would be facilitated by variability of practice. The results confirmed schema theory. Subjects with variable practice showed greater transfer to a novel speed outside the range of training than subjects trained under constant practice. A generalization gradient was obtained. Further the novel conditions were from training conditions, the poorer the transfer a p peared to be. However, generalization decrement was attenuated with variable practice.},

We recently developed a motor learning paradigm that reveals the categorical organization of motor memories of object dynamics. When participants repeatedly lift a constant-density ``family'' of cylindrical objects that vary in size, and then an outlier object with a greater density is interleaved into the sequence of lifts, they often fail to learn the weight of the outlier, persistently treating it as a family member despite repeated errors. Here we examine eight factors (Similarity, Cardinality, Frequency, History, Structure, Stochasticity, Persistence, and Time Pressure) that could influence the formation and retrieval of category representations in the outlier paradigm. In our web-based task, participants (N\,=\,240) anticipated object weights by stretching a virtual spring attached to the top of each object. Using Bayesian t-tests, we analyze the relative impact of each manipulated factor on categorical encoding (strengthen, weaken, or no effect). Our results suggest that category representations of object weight are automatic, rigid, and linear and, as a consequence, the key determinant of whether an outlier is encoded as a member of the family is its discriminability from the family members.},

In both experiments, subjects performed 300 trials per day of three variations of a three-segment timing task over 4 days of acquisition. The subjects then either immediately transferred to four novel variations of the same task (Experiment 1 ) that varied in degree of similarity to the exemplars experienced during acquisition; or performed two novel and two previously produced exemplars, following 24-h and I-week retention intervals (Experiment 2). The results indicated that novel task transfer was not affected by the degree of similarity between the acquisition and transfer exemplars, and that there was no advantage for a previously produced exemplar over a novel exemplar after either a 24-hr or 1week retention interval. Also, in both experiments, a consistent pattern of bias in responding was noted for novel task transfer and retention. These results are indicative of a schema abstraction model of memory representation for motor skills.},

Active production of motor skills has not been used in experimental designs that have provided empirical support for this view of representation, however. Much of the faith in centralized, abstracted forms of memory representation for motor skills is due to the popularity of Schmidt's schema theory, which has adapted the prototype abstraction model from category learning research to the representation of motor skills. Since schema theory was proposed, however, an alternative view that seriously questions the preeminence of the prototype abstraction model for the central representation of knowledge has arisen in the category learning literature. This particular view, termed the spec\& exemplar model, has led a number of researchers in cognition to develop mixed models that involve both prototypic abstraction and specific exemplar elements. This note. then, identifies what can be perceived as a gap in the empirical knowledge base in motor behavior and discusses the possibility of using the debate about representation for category learning as a stimulus for initiating a similar investigation into the representation of motor skills. A hypothetical specific exemplar model for the memory representation of motor skills is outlined, and possible empirical comparisons between this model and the schema abstraction model are suggested.},

Speech-sound training in adults induces changes in cue-weighting such that relevant acoustic cues are emphasized. In the current study, the extent to which individual variability in cue weighting contributes to differential success in learning to use foreign sound patterns was examined. Sixteen English-speaking adult participants underwent a sound-to-meaning training paradigm, during which they learned to incorporate Mandarin linguistic pitch contours into words. In addition to cognitive tests, measures of pitch pattern discrimination and identification were collected from all participants. Reaction time data from the discrimination task was subjected to 3-way multidimensional scaling to extract dimensions underlying tone perception. Two dimensions relating to pitch height and pitch direction were found to underlie non-native tone space. Good learners attended more to pitch direction relative to poor learners, before and after training. Training increased the ability to identify and label pitch direction. The results demonstrate that variability in the ability to successfully learn to use pitch in lexical contexts can be explained by pre-training differences in cue-weighting.},

Some researchers have claimed that word frequency has no effect once such diversity measures are taken into account (Adelman et al., 2006). Taking advantage of the power of five large-scale databases, we investigated the effects of SemD, word frequency, and their interaction in five tasks, including word reading, lexical and concreteness decision, object picture naming, and word repetition. We found: (a) word frequency and SemD effects were consistently distinct; (b) effects of SemD were facilitatory in nearly all tasks, but inhibitory effects were also found; contrary to existing claims, we conclude that inhibitory SemD effects do not necessarily imply semantic selection requirements; (c) the presence of SemD effects minimally influenced the size of frequency effects when SemD was left uncontrolled, suggesting that SemD does not explain absent frequency effects in the patient literature; and (d) word frequency and SemD only interact in the largest data sets. Results are discussed in the context of rational models of memory (Anderson \& Milson, 1989; Anderson \& Schooler, 1991) and the Controlled Semantic Cognition framework (Lambon Ralph et al., 2017).

  abstract = {We can monitor our intentional movements, in order to describe how we move our bodies. But it is unclear which information this metacognitive monitoring relies on. For example, when throwing a ball to hit a target, we might use the visual information about how the ball flew to metacognitively assess our performance. Alternatively, we might disregard the ball trajectory {\textemdash} given that it is not directly relevant to our goal {\textemdash} and metacognitively assess our performance based solely on whether we reached the goal of hitting the target. In two experiments we aimed to distinguish between these two alternatives and asked whether the distal outcome of a goal-directed action (hitting or missing a target) informs the metacognitive representations of our own movements. Participants performed a semi-virtual task where they moved their arm to throw a virtual ball at a target. After each throw, participants discriminated which of two ball trajectories displayed on the screen corresponded to the flight path of their throw and then rated their confidence in this decision. The task included two conditions that differed on whether the distal outcome of the two trajectories shown matched (congruent) or differed (incongruent). Participants were significantly more accurate in discriminating between the two trajectories, and responded faster in the incongruent condition and, accordingly, were significantly more confident on these trials. Crucially, we found significant differences in metacognitive performance (measured as meta-d'/d') between the two conditions only on successful trials, where the virtual ball had hit the target. These results indicate that participants successfully incorporated information about the outcome of the movement into both their discrimination and confidence responses. However, information about the outcome selectively sharpened the precision of confidence ratings only when the outcome of their throw matched their intention. We argue that these findings underline the separation between the different levels of information that may contribute to body monitoring, and we provide evidence that intentions might play a central role in metacognitive motor representations.},

How far is it possible to construct universal principles in the cognitive sciences, in terms of which specific aspects of perception, memory, or decision making might be modelled? Following Shepard (e.g., 1987), it is argued that some universal principles may be attainable in cognitive science. Here, 2 examples are proposed: the simplicity principle (which states that the cognitive system prefers patterns that provide simpler explanations of available data); and the scale-invariance principle, which states that many cognitive phenomena are independent of the scale of relevant underlying physical variables, such as time, space, luminance, or sound pressure. This article illustrates how principles may be combined to explain specific cognitive processes by using these principles to derive SIMPLE, a formal model of memory for serial order (Brown, Neath, \& Chater, 2007), and briefly mentions some extensions to models of identification and categorization. This article also considers the scope and limitations of universal laws in cognitive science.},

The impact that each sample wielded over choices depended on its consistency with the previous sample, with more consistent or expected samples wielding the greatest influence over choice.

Benefits of practice variability have been attributed to motor schema formation (variable versus constant practice), or more effortful information processing (random versus blocked practice). We hypothesized that, among other mechanisms, greater practice variability might promote an external focus of attention on the intended movement effect, while less variability would be more conducive to a less effective internal focus on body movements. In Experiment 1, the learning of a throwing task was enhanced by variable versus constant practice, and variable group participants reported focusing more on the distance to the target (external focus), while constant group participants focused more on their posture (internal focus). In Experiment 2, golf putting was learned more effectively with a random compared with a blocked practice schedule. Furthermore, random group learners reported using a more effective distal external focus (i.e., distance to the target) to a greater extent, whereas blocked group participants used a less effective proximal focus (i.e., putter) more often. While attentional focus was assessed through questionnaires in the first two experiments, learners in Experiment 3 were asked to report their current attentional focus at any time during practice. Again, the learning of a throwing task was more effective after random relative to blocked practice. Also, random practice learners reported using more external focus cues, while in blocked practice participants used more internal focus cues. The findings suggest that the attentional foci induced by different practice schedules might be at least partially responsible for the learning differences.},

Consciousness and Cognition, 21, 1393{\textendash}1400] points to limitations in the sequential approach. In the experiment, participants studied words selected according to a conjunctive rule. At test, participants discriminated rule-consistent from rule-violating words but could not verbalize the rule. Although the data elude explanation by sequential models, an exemplar model of implicit learning can explain them. To make the case, we simulate the full pattern of results by incorporating vector representations for the words used in the experiment, derived from the large-scale semantic space models LSA and BEAGLE, into an exemplar model of memory, MINERVA 2. We show that basic memory processes in a classic model of memory capture implicit learning of non-sequential rules, provided that stimuli are appropriately represented.},

  abstract = {Scale	invariance,	the	notion	that	scientific	principles	ought	to	hold	over	different	scales	of	 analysis,	is	a	regularity	in	the	physical	and biological	sciences but	is	underappreciated	in	 psychology.	Whereas	the	standard	approach	in	psychology	is	to	explain behaviours	at	 different	scales	of	analysis	with	different	mechanisms, I	argue	that sophisticated	behaviours	 at	any	scale	are	an	emergent	consequence	of	simple	processes	interacting	with	a	structured	 environment.	Changing	the	scale	of	analysis,	whether	temporal,	physical,	or	otherwise,	may	 alter the	structure	of	the	environment	but	need	not	imply	changes	to	the mechanisms that interact with	that	environment.	To	illustrate	the	centrality	of scale	invariance and	 emergence	to	human	cognition,	I	replicate	signature	findings	from	a	function	learning	task	 after	scaling	up	the	unit	of	analysis, from	individuals	to	groups. In	a	standard	function	 learning	task,	individuals	learn	the	relationship	between	two	variables	by	trial	and	error, matching	one	variable	(i.e.,	Y)	to	a	target	value	of	the	other	variable	(i.e.,	X) and	adjusting	 their	responses	according	to	feedback.	In	an	analogous	group	function	learning	task,	groups	 of	non-communicating	individuals	learn	the	relationship	between	two	variables	by	making individual-level	decisions	in	response	to	group-level	feedback.	My	experiments	with	this	 task	demonstrate	that	groups,	like	individuals, can	learn	both	simple	and	complex	functions by	trial	and	error,	and	can	generalize	their	knowledge	of	a	trained	function	to	untrained	 target	values in	a	transfer	test.	Groups are,	moreover, resilient	to	disruption	of	their	 knowledge,	a	central	feature of	distributed	representations	in biological and	artificial	 neural	networks.	The	results	recommend	a	principled	approach	to	cognition,	in	which	 simple	processes	interact	with	the	structure	of	the	environment	to	produce	sophisticated behaviours,	and	in	which	the	patterns	of	behaviour	produced	at	one	scale	of	analysis	are	 iii reproduced at	other	scales. Finally,	the	data	show	that,	when	constrained	by	a	collective	 environment	and	common	goals,	individuals	self-organize	into	unique	decision	roles that	 support	group-level	learning.

Our 2-mechanism model predicts that aftereffects will still be observed when returning to the original environment, indicating a lack of skill transfer from the artificial environment to the original environment. To illustrate the model prediction, we tested 10 healthy participants on the interaction between a simple overlearned motor skill (straight hand movements to targets in different directions) and an artificially altered visuomotor environment (rotation of visual feedback of the results of movement).~ As predicted by the models, participants show adaptation to the altered environment and after-effects on return to the baseline environment even when practice in the altered environment should have led to correct skill performance. ~The presence of aftereffect under all conditions that involved changes in environment demonstrates separation of environmental adaptation and skill learning. Our results support the existence of two distinct learning modules with different adaptation properties.~ Therefore we suggest that adaptation to an altered environment may not be useful for training new skills.},

To clarify its origins, we measured the human capacity (N = 521) to extrapolate linear and expo\- nential trends in scatterplots. Four factors were manipulated: the function underlying the data (linear or expo\- nential), the response modality (pointing or venturing a number), the scale on the y axis (linear or logarithmic), and the amount of noise in the data. While linear extrapolation was precise and largely unbiased, we observed a consistent underestimation of noisy exponential growth, present for both pointing and numerical responses. A biased ideal-observer model could explain these data as an occasional misperception of noisy exponential graphs as quadratic curves. Importantly, this underestimation bias was mitigated by participants' math knowledge, by using a logarithmic scale, and by presenting a noiseless exponential curve rather than a noisy data plot, thus suggesting concrete avenues for interventions.},

Through a series of four behavioral experiments, we characterized human performance in ``mental regression'', i.e. the perception of statistical trends from scatterplots. When presented with a noisy scatterplot, even as briefly as 100~ms, human adults could accurately judge if it was increasing or decreasing, fit a regression line, and extrapolate outside the original data range, for both linear and non-linear functions. Performance was highly consistent across those three tasks of trend judgment, line fitting and extrapolation. Participants' linear trend judgments took into account the slope, the noise, and the number of data points, and were tightly correlated with the t-test classically used to evaluate the significance of a linear regression. However, they overestimated the absolute value of the regression slope. This bias was inconsistent with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which minimizes the sum of square deviations, but consistent with the use of Deming regression, which treats the x and y axes symmetrically and minimizes the Euclidean distance to the fitting line. We speculate that this fast but biased perception of scatterplots may be based on a ``neuronal recycling'' of the human visual capacity to identify the medial axis of a shape.},

Graphicacy, the ability to understand graphs, has thus become a fundamental cultural skill comparable to literacy or numeracy. Here, we introduce a measure of intuitive graphicacy that assesses the perceptual ability to detect a trend in noisy scatterplots (``does this graph go up or down?''). In 3943 educated participants, responses vary as a sigmoid function of the t-value that a statistician would compute to detect a significant trend. We find a minimum level of core intuitive graphicacy even in unschooled participants living in remote Namibian villages (N\,=\,87) and 6-year-old 1st-graders who never read a graph (N\,=\,27). The sigmoid slope that we propose as a proxy of intuitive graphicacy increases with education and tightly correlates with statistical and mathematical knowledge, showing that experience contributes to refining graphical intuitions. Our tool, publicly available online, allows to quickly evaluate and formally quantify a perceptual building block of graphicacy.},

  abstract = {Within behavioral science, it is common for data to be paradigmatically collected through repeated measurement of behavior (e.g., on each of 400 trials a human presses one of two buttons to indicate which of two possible stimuli they saw). Typical analytic tools used alongside such designs, such as ANOVA, linear regression, or T tests, implicitly assume that the data arises from distributions that are stationary across the repeated individual measurements (i.e., that every trial is independently and identically sampled from the same distribution, or iid, conditional on experimentally manipulated or observed variables). Interestingly, the use of such analytic tools is common even in those areas of behavioral science that are inherently concerned with time-evolving changes in behavior such as learning, memory, priming, adaptation, vigilance, cognitive control. For instance, in learning research it is common for researchers to first divide the repeated measurements into temporal bins (e.g., trials 1-100; 101-200; 201-300). They then calculate means within those bins, before applying the analysis tools above. Such an analytic method is explicitly modelling a process where performance can change between, but not within, bins. That is, conditional stationarity is assumed within the temporal bins. Beyond these fields, research methods in many others (e.g., attention, development, neuroscience, perception) attempt to by-pass the problem of non-stationarity by utilizing practice trials prior to collecting behavioral data. Practice trials are intended to give participants enough practice with the task that they reach a stable level of performance. However, whether this assumption is true is rarely tested. Our previous work has demonstrated, across several different experimental contexts, that by-trial modeling of performance provides estimates of the full timecourse of behavioral change. In doing so, these models of nonlinear monotonic trend stationarity provide both better estimates of behavior, as well as allowing for deeper inferences regarding the underlying processes at work, than statistical methods that assume that behavioral data remains unconditionally stationary over the course of a set of measurements (Kattner, Cochrane, \& Green, 2017).},

When participants in the present study took hold of a vertical cylinder to move it to a new position, grasp heights on the cylinder were inversely related to the height of the target position, as predicted by the end-state comfort effect. This demonstrates that where people grasp objects can give insight into the planning of movement. In the computational model of motor planning developed by Rosenbaum et al. (1995, 2001) it is assumed that goal postures are planned by a two-stage process of recall and generation. The distinction between recall and generation had not so far been tested. In the present study, the pattern of grasp heights in successive transports was consistent with the view that participants generated a plan the first time they moved the cylinder between two points, and that they subsequently recalled what they had done before, making small adjustments to that recalled plan. This outcome provides evidence for distinct effects of recall and generation on movement planning.},

We hypothesize that this effect becomes especially pronounced when cues are presented numerically rather than verbally, because numbers elicit expectations about a task with a simple numerical solution that can be appropriately addressed by linear and additive integration. This predicts that, relative to a verbal format, a numerical format should be advantageous for learning in additive tasks, but detrimental for learning in non-additive tasks. In two experiments, we find support for the hypothesis that a verbal format can improve learning in non-additive tasks. The division-of-labor between cognitive processes observed in previous research (Juslin et al., 2008), with cue abstraction in additive tasks and exemplar memory in non-additive tasks, was only present in conditions with numeric information and may therefore in part be driven by the use of numeric formats. This illustrates how surface characteristic of stimuli can elicit different priors about the nature of the variables and the generative model that produced the cues and the criterion. We fitted cue-abstraction and exemplar algorithms by PNP-modeling (Sundh et al., 2021). At the end of training both cue abstraction and exemplar memory processes primarily involved exact analytic processes marred by occasional error, rather than the noisy and approximate intuitive processes typically assumed in previous studies {\textendash} specifically, cue abstraction was primarily implemented by number crunching and exemplar memory by rote memorization.},

We examined the computations underlying judgments of agency, in particular under the influence of sensory noise. Building on previous literature, we studied whether judgments of agency incorporate uncertainty in the same way that confidence judgments do, which would imply that the former share computational mechanisms with metacognitive judgments. In two tasks, participants rated agency, or confidence in a decision about their agency, over a virtual hand that tracked their movements, either synchronously or with a delay and either under high or low noise. We compared the predictions of two computational models to participants' ratings and found that agency ratings, unlike confidence, were best explained by a model involving no estimates of sensory noise. We propose that agency judgments reflect first-order measures of the internal signal, without involving metacognitive computations, challenging the assumed link between the two cognitive processes.},

However, in laboratory studies, feedback used to examine how humans learn new categories has almost invariably been categorical in nature (i.e. Correct/Incorrect, or A/Not-A). Whether numerical or categorical feedback leads to better learning is an open question. One possibility is that numerical feedback could give more fine-grained information about a category. Alternatively, categorical feedback is more dichotomous, potentially leading to larger error signals. Here we test how feedback impacts category learning by having participants learn to categorize novel line stimuli from either numerical, categorical, or a combination of both types of feedback. Performance was better for categorical relative to the more variable numerical feedback. However, participants were able to learn to effectively categorize from numerical feedback, and providing larger numerical rewards for easier, more representative stimuli was more successful in promoting learning than providing larger rewards for harder to classify stimuli. Simulations and fits of a connectionist model to participants' performance data suggest that categorical feedback promotes better learning by eliciting larger prediction errors than numerical feedback.},

Then one defined a large class of possible models (including the best two identified predictors) and the class maximal possible prediction accuracy was evaluated. A new model of quick multivariate function approximation belonging to this class was proposed. Its prediction accuracy was close to the maximum possible, and significantly better than that of all other models tested. The new model also provided a significant account of human response variability. Finally, it was shown that this model is more particularly suitable for problems in which the visual system can perform some specific structuring of the data space. This model is therefore considered as a suitable starting point for further investigations into quick multivariate function approximation, which is to date an inadequately explored question in cognitive psychology.},

As an example, we show how this method can be used to evaluate the Exemplar-Based Random-Walk model of categorization (EBRW; Nosofsky \& Palmeri, 1997a). EBRW is an extension of the Generalized Context Model (GCM; Nosofsky, 1984, Nosofsky, 1986). It predicts that the mean response times (RTs) follow a power function. It can be shown analytically, however, that the learning rate (i.e., the curvature) predicted by the model can only be equal to 1, a value rarely observed in empirical data analyses. We also explored an extended version of EBRW including background noise elements (Nosofsky \& Alfonso-Reese, 1999) and identified conditions under which this model can predict curvatures different from 1. The limitation of these models to predict a wide variety of curvatures as observed in human data can be resolved by a simple extension to EBRW in which the original exponential distribution of retrieval times is replaced by a Weibull distribution. Additional predictions regarding learning curves are discussed.},

We present results from a study in which 453 participants took part in five different memory tasks: single-item recognition, associative recognition, cued recall, free recall, and lexical decision. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we jointly analyzed the correlations between tasks within individuals{\textemdash}reflecting the degree to which tasks rely on shared cognitive processes{\textemdash}and within items{\textemdash}reflecting the degree to which tasks rely on the same information conveyed by the item. Among other things, we find that (a) the processes involved in lexical access and episodic memory are largely separate and rely on different kinds of information, (b) access to lexical memory is driven primarily by perceptual aspects of a word, (c) all episodic memory tasks rely to an extent on a set of shared processes which make use of semantic features to encode both single words and associations between words, and (d) recall involves additional processes likely related to contextual cuing and response production. These results provide a large-scale picture of memory across different tasks which can serve to drive the development of comprehensive theories of memory.},

Skilled typists' performance improved during practice with typing words composed from a specific set of letters. In a transfer phase, performance was fastest for trained words, followed by new words composed of trained letters, and slowest for new words composed of untrained letters.

We use skilled typing of natural text to evaluate correspondence between performance (keystroke timing) and structure in the environment (letter uncertainty).

We reproduced Ostry's (1983) analysis of interkeystroke interval as a function of letter position and word length, that showed prominent first-letter and midword slowing effects. We propose a novel account that letter position and word length effects on keystroke dynamics reflect informational uncertainty about letters in those locations, rather than resource limited planning/buffering processes. We computed positional uncertainty for letters in all positions of words from length one to nine using Google's n-gram database. We show that variance in interkeystroke interval by letter position and word length tracks natural variation in letter uncertainty. Finally, we provide a model showing how a general learning and memory process could acquire sensitivity to patterns of letter uncertainty in natural English. In doing so, we draw an equivalence between Logan's (1988) instance theory of automatization and Shannon's measure of entropy (H) from information theory. Instance theory's predictions for automatization as a function of experience follow exactly the uncertainty in the choice set being automatized. As a result, instance theory stands as a general process model explaining how context-specific experiences in a structured environment tune skilled performance.},

We compared one of the Generalized Motor Program (GMP) invariant features, i.e., relative timing, of the same variation of skill developed in constant and variable practice conditions. In two experiments, participants, na{\"i}ve to the basketball, were practicing free throws, receiving the same amount of practice. In constant conditions they practiced at one distance only (4.57 m), whereas in variable conditions they practiced at seven (2.74, 3.35, 3.96, 4.57, 5.18, 5.79, and 6.4 m) and five (3.35, 3.96, 4.57, 5.18, and 5.79 m) distances, in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. We found that relative timing of skills developed in constant and variable practice conditions is the same, confirming that these practice conditions form the same memory representation. However, we also observed that constant practice (CP) conditions resulted in overall shorter movement time as compared to the skill practiced in variable conditions. We hypothesized that it may be due to the facilitation of parameters assignment as it takes place in especial skill.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that the recall schema becomes more refined after constant practice. It is also believed that massive amounts of constant practice eventually leads to the emergence of especial skills, i.e., skills that have an advantage in performance over other actions from within the same class of actions. This advantage in performance was noticed when one-criterion practice, e.g., basketball free throws, was compared to non-practiced variations of the skill. However, there is no evidence whether multi-criterion massive amounts of practice would give an advantage to the trained variations of the skill over non-trained, i.e., whether such practice would eventually lead to the development of (multi)-especial skills. The purpose of this study was to determine whether massive amount of practice involving four criterion variations of the skill will give an advantage in performance to the criterions over the class of actions. In two experiments, we analyzed data from female (n = 8) and male classical archers (n = 10), who were required to shoot 30 shots from four accustomed distances, i.e., males at 30, 50, 70, and 90 m and females at 30, 50, 60, and 70 m. The shooting accuracy for the untrained distances (16 distances in men and 14 in women) was used to compile a regression line for distance over shooting accuracy. Regression determined (expected) values were then compared to the shooting accuracy of the trained distances. Data revealed no significant differences between real and expected results at trained distances, except for the 70 m shooting distance in men. The F-test for lack of fit showed that the regression computed for trained and non-trained shooting distances was linear. It can be concluded that especial skills emerge only after very specific practice, i.e., constant practice limited to only one variation of the skill.},

  abstract = {Decision-making is a complex action requiring efficient information processing. Specifically, in movement in which performance efficiency depends on reaction time, e.g., open-loop controlled movements, these processes may play a crucial role. Information processing includes three distinct stages, stimulus identification, response selection, and response programming. Mainly, response selection may play a substantial contribution to the reaction time and appropriate decision making. The duration of this stage depends on the number of possible choices an individual has to ``screen'' to make a proper decision. Given that reaction time is crucial in many sports, the possibilities of reducing it through practice are very tempting. The information processing and its relationship to the manner an individual is practicing are discussed. Especially the variability of practice issues will be explored. In variable practice conditions, an individual has to react to one or more stimuli and has to produce one of the many variations of the same movement or different movements they learned. One has to identify a stimulus appropriately and has to select a response optimally, i.e., choosing from as few choices as possible to reduce the reaction time. On the other hand, in constant practice conditions, an individual can be exposed to one or many stimuli. Still, there is only one variation of the movement that can be executed in the presence of a learned stimulus. Based on the information processing theory and the results of the research focusing on variability of practice, I discuss how the practice conditions may affect reaction time and, as a result, the decision-making process. I conceptually frame the possible implications of practice conditions on decision making related to information processing. In this review, a possible mechanism and relationship between practice conditions and decision-making are presented. Future research directions are presented.},

The current study used best subsets regression with cross-validation and independent test samples to identify the SRET metrics most reliably associated with depression symptoms in three large samples: a college student sample (n = 572), a sample of adults from Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 293), and an adolescent sample from a school field study (n = 408). Across all 3 samples, SRET metrics associated most strongly with depression severity included number of words endorsed as self-descriptive and rate of accumulation of information required to decide whether adjectives were self-descriptive (i.e., drift rate). These metrics had strong intratask and split-half reliability and high test{\textendash}retest reliability across a 1-week period. Recall of SRET stimuli and traditional reaction time (RT) metrics were not robustly associated with depression severity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Here we tested how participants learn movement trajectories where feedback is provided as a monetary reward that depends on the chosen trajectory.

Such extrapolation is by definition underdetermined and is dictated by a learner's inductive biases. Machine learning systems often do not share the same inductive biases as humans and, as a result, extrapolate in ways that are inconsistent with our expectations. We investigate two distinct such inductive biases: feature-level bias (differences in which features are more readily learned) and exemplar-vs-rule bias (differences in how these learned features are used for generalization). Exemplar- vs. rule-based generalization has been studied extensively in cognitive psychology, and, in this work, we present a protocol inspired by these experimental approaches for directly probing this trade-off in learning systems. The measures we propose characterize changes in extrapolation behavior when feature coverage is manipulated in a combinatorial setting. We present empirical results across a range of models and across both expository and real-world image and language domains. We demonstrate that measuring the exemplar-rule trade-off while controlling for feature-level bias provides a more complete picture of extrapolation behavior than existing formalisms. We find that most standard neural network models have a propensity towards exemplar-based extrapolation and discuss the implications of these findings for research on data augmentation, fairness, and systematic generalization.},

  abstract = {Generalization (or transfer) is the ability to repurpose knowledge in novel settings. It is often asserted that generalization is an important ingredient of human intelligence, but its extent, nature, and determinants have proved controversial. Here, we examine this ability with a paradigm that formalizes the transfer learning problem as one of recom- posing existing functions to solve unseen problems. We find that people can generalize compositionally in ways that are elusive for standard neural networks and that human generalization benefits from training regimes in which items are axis aligned and tem- porally correlated. We describe a neural network model based around a Hebbian gating process that can capture how human generalization benefits from different training cur- ricula. We additionally find that adult humans tend to learn composable functions asynchronously, exhibiting discontinuities in learning that resemble those seen in child development.},

To investigate this phenomenon and determine the most effective representations for predicting human behavior, we conducted two experiments involving category learning and reward learning. Our experiments used realistic images as stimuli, and participants were tasked with making accurate decisions based on novel stimuli for all trials, thereby necessitating generalization. In both tasks, the underlying rules were generated as simple linear functions using stimulus dimensions extracted from human similarity judgments. Notably, participants successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalization. We performed an extensive model comparison, evaluating the trial-by-trial predictive accuracy of diverse deep learning models' representations of human choices. Intriguingly, representations from models trained on both text and image data consistently outperformed models trained solely on images, even surpassing models using the features that generated the task itself. These findings suggest that language-aligned visual representations possess sufficient richness to describe human generalization in naturalistic settings and emphasize the role of language in shaping human cognition.},

Because they are naturally highly correlated, previous work has been unable to dissociate the contribution of 2 properties: contextual variability (the number of unique phonological contexts in which a phonotactic pattern appears) and exemplar strength (the overall number of times the pattern appears). Using an artificial language learning paradigm, 3 experiments disentangled the effects of variability and strength, indexed by type and token frequency, respectively, on the learning of gradient phonotactics. When the 2 factors were decorrelated (Experiment 2), participants showed greater generalization of patterns advantaged for contextual variability, but not those advantaged for exemplar strength. When the 2 factors were anticorrelated (Experiment 3), participants preferred patterns advantaged in contextual variability, even though they were disadvantaged for exemplar strength. These results suggest that contextual variability is the key force driving phonotactic learning, as it allows learners to home in on the invariant features of the input.},

Although exemplar models have been found to be deficient in explaining rule-based extrapolation, Rodrigues and Murre (2007) offered a variation of an exemplar model that was better able to account for such performance. Here, we present the results of a new rule-plus-exception experiment that yields rule-like extrapolation similar to that of previous experiments, and yet the data are not accounted for by Rodrigues and Murre's augmented exemplar model. Further, a hybrid rule-and-exemplar model is shown to better describe the data. Thus, we maintain that rule-plus-exception categorization continues to be a challenge for exemplar-only models.},

In three experiments (total N~=~222), participants learned about the values of experimentally created distributions of income values and city sizes and later estimated the mean value of the four quarters of values. We expected participants to draw on heuristic shortcuts to generate such judgments. More specifically, we hypothesized that participants use the endpoints of the distributions as anchors and determine the mean values by linear interpolation. In addition, we tested the contribution of three further processes (Range-Frequency adjustments, Normal Smoothing, Linear Smoothing). Quantitative model tests suggest that anchoring and Linear Smoothing both affected mean interquartile judgments.

Here, we derived a family of goal functions that explicitly defined infinite possible redundancies between distance (D) and time (T) for unidirectional reaching. All [T, D] combinations satisfying any specific goal function defined a goal-equivalent manifold (GEM). We tested how humans learned two such functions, D/T = c (constant speed) and D{$\cdot$}T = c, that were very different but could both be achieved by neurophysiologically and biomechanically similar reaching movements. Subjects were never explicitly shown either relationship, but only instructed to minimize their errors. Subjects exhibited significant learning and consolidation of learning for both tasks. Initial error magnitudes were higher, but learning rates were faster, for the D{$\cdot$}T task than for the D/T task. Learning the D/T task first facilitated subsequent learning of the D{$\cdot$}T task. Conversely, learning the D{$\cdot$}T task first interfered with subsequent learning of the D/T task. Analyses of trial-to-trial dynamics demonstrated that subjects actively corrected deviations perpendicular to each GEM faster than deviations along each GEM to the same degree for both tasks, despite exhibiting significantly greater variance ratios for the D/T task. Variance measures alone failed to capture critical features of trial-to-trial control. Humans actively exploited these abstract task redundancies, even though they did not have to. They did not use readily available alternative strategies that could have achieved the same performance.},

  abstract = {High variability (HV) training has been found to be more effective than low variability (LV) training when learning various non-native phonetic contrasts. However, little research has considered whether this applies to the learning of tone contrasts. The only two relevant studies suggested that the effect of HV training depends on the perceptual aptitude of participants (Perrachione et al., 2011; Sadakata \& McQueen, 2014). The present study extends these findings by examining the interaction between individual aptitude and input variability using natural, meaningful second language input (both previous studies used pseudowords). A total of 60 English speakers took part in an eight session phonetic training paradigm. They were assigned to high/low/high-blocked variability training groups and learned real Mandarin tones and words. Individual aptitude was measured following previous work. Learning was measured using one discrimination task, one identification task and two production tasks. All tasks assessed generalization. All groups improved in both the production and perception of tones which transferred to untrained voices and items, demonstrating the effectiveness of training despite the increased complexity compared with previous research. Although the LV group exhibited an advantage with the training stimuli, there was no evidence for a benefit of high-variability in any of the tests of generalisation. Moreover, although aptitude significantly predicted performance in discrimination, identification and training tasks, no interaction between individual aptitude and variability was revealed. Additional Bayes Factor analyses indicated substantial evidence for the null for the hypotheses of a benefit of high-variability in generalisation, however the evidence regarding the interaction was ambiguous. We discuss these results in light of previous findings.},

Our experimental paradigm includes the presentation of nonreinforced transfer stimuli that improve one's ability to discriminate among the predictions of alternative models. Our modelselection techniques incorporate uncertainty in the identification of individuals as either rule-based or information-integration strategy users. Based on this analysis we identify 48\% of participants as unequivocally using an information-integration strategy. However, adopting the standard practice of using a restricted set of models, restricted data, and ignoring the degree of support for a particular strategy, we would typically conclude that 89\% of participants used an information-integration strategy. We discuss the implications of potentially erroneous strategy identification for the security of conclusions about the categorization capabilities of various participant and patient groups.},

We discovered that formal memory-strength parameters from an exemplar-recognition model closely followed a power function of the lag between studied items and a test probe. The model accounted for rich sets of response time (RT) data at both individual-subject and individual-lag levels. Because memory strengths were derived from model fits to choices and RTs from individual trials, the psychological power law was independent of the scale used to summarize the forgetting functions. Alternative models that assumed different functional relations or posited a separate fixed-strength working memory store fared considerably worse than the power-law model did in predicting the data.},

  abstract = {The notion that human learning follows a smooth power law (PL) of diminishing gains is well-established in psychology. This characteristic is observed when multiple curves are averaged, potentially masking more complex dynamics underpinning the curves of individual learners. Here, we analyzed 25,280 individual learning curves, each comprising 500 measurements of cognitive performance taken from four cognitive tasks. A piecewise PL (PPL) model explained the individual learning curves significantly better than a single PL, controlling for model complexity. The PPL model allows for multiple PLs connected at different points in the learning process. We also explored the transition dynamics between PL curve component pieces. Performance in later pieces typically surpassed that in earlier pieces, after a brief drop in performance at the transition point. The transition rate was negatively associated with age, even after controlling for overall performance. Our results suggest at least two processes at work in individual learning curves: locally, a gradual, smooth improvement, with diminishing gains within a specific strategy, which is modeled well as a PL; and globally, a discrete sequence of strategy shifts, in which each strategy is better in the long term than the ones preceding it. The piecewise extension of the classic PL of practice has implications for both individual skill acquisition and theories of learning.},

Involving factors influencing human confidence in the existence of a functional link between two supposed variables has not so far been discussed in function learning literature. By examining this problem and based on relevant results from cognitive psychology, I propose a hypothesis according to which human confidence in a link between cue and criterion is affected by three factors: The difficulty of functions, the level of noise in observed data, and the sample size. Here, the formalization of this hypothesis forms a novel mathematical model of function learning which can also be used for predictions; so the resulting model receives cue-criterion pairs of a supposed relation and produces two outputs: Confidence and predicting function. In an experiment, the performance of a computational implementation of the model is compared with human data. The results show that the model is successful in tracking changes in human confidence. A close correspondence between the predictions of the model and humans was also achieved.},

Whereas	the	standard	approach	in	psychology	is	to	explain behaviours	at	 different	scales	of	analysis	with	different	mechanisms, I	argue	that sophisticated	behaviours	 at	any	scale	are	an	emergent	consequence	of	simple	processes	interacting	with	a	structured	 environment.	Changing	the	scale	of	analysis,	whether	temporal,	physical,	or	otherwise,	may	 alter the	structure	of	the	environment	but	need	not	imply	changes	to	the mechanisms that interact with	that	environment.	To	illustrate	the	centrality	of scale	invariance and	 emergence	to	human	cognition,	I	replicate	signature	findings	from	a	function	learning	task	 after	scaling	up	the	unit	of	analysis, from	individuals	to	groups. In	a	standard	function	 learning	task,	individuals	learn	the	relationship	between	two	variables	by	trial	and	error, matching	one	variable	(i.e.,	Y)	to	a	target	value	of	the	other	variable	(i.e.,	X) and	adjusting	 their	responses	according	to	feedback.	In	an	analogous	group	function	learning	task,	groups	 of	non-communicating	individuals	learn	the	relationship	between	two	variables	by	making individual-level	decisions	in	response	to	group-level	feedback.	My	experiments	with	this	 task	demonstrate	that	groups,	like	individuals, can	learn	both	simple	and	complex	functions by	trial	and	error,	and	can	generalize	their	knowledge	of	a	trained	function	to	untrained	 target	values in	a	transfer	test.	Groups are,	moreover, resilient	to	disruption	of	their	 knowledge,	a	central	feature of	distributed	representations	in biological and	artificial	 neural	networks.

We explored the possible impacts of autism-related neural abnormalities on perceptual category learning using a neural network model of visual cortical processing. When applied to experiments in which children or adults were trained to classify complex two-dimensional images, the model can account for atypical patterns of perceptual generalization. This is only possible, however, when individual differences in learning are taken into account. In particular, analyses performed with a self-organizing map suggested that individuals with high-functioning ASD show two distinct generalization patterns: one that is comparable to typical patterns, and a second in which there is almost no generalization. The model leads to novel predictions about how individuals will generalize when trained with simplified input sets and can explain why some researchers have failed to detect learning or generalization deficits in prior studies of category learning by individuals with autism. On the basis of these simulations, we propose that deficits in basic neural plasticity mechanisms may be sufficient to account for the atypical patterns of perceptual category learning and generalization associated with autism, but they do not account for why only a subset of individuals with autism would show such deficits. If variations in performance across subgroups reflect heterogeneous neural abnormalities, then future behavioral and neuroimaging studies of individuals with ASD will need to account for such disparities.},

European Journal of Cognitive Psychology, 21, 522{\textendash}560, 2009), several studies have suggested that the motor system used to interact with objects in our environment is involved in object recognition (e.g., Helbig, Graf, \& Kiefer Experimental Brain Research, 174, 221-228, 2006). However, the role of the motor system in immediate memory for objects is more controversial. The objective of the present study was to investigate the role of the motor system in object memory by manipulating the similarity between the actions associated to series of objects to be retained in memory. In Experiment 1, we showed that lists of objects associated to dissimilar actions were better recalled than lists associated to similar actions. We then showed that this effect was abolished when participants were required to perform a concurrent motor suppression task (Experiment 2) and when the objects to be memorized were unmanipulable (Experiment 3). The motor similarity effect provides evidence for the role of motor affordances in object memory.},

  abstract = {Humans have the fascinating ability to achieve goals in a complex and constantly changing world, still surpassing modern machine-learning algorithms in terms of flexibility and learning speed. It is generally accepted that a crucial factor for this ability is the use of abstract, hierarchical representations, which employ structure in the environment to guide learning and decision making. Nevertheless, how we create and use these hierarchical representations is poorly understood. This study presents evidence that human behavior can be characterized as hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL). We designed an experiment to test specific predictions of hierarchical RL using a series of subtasks in the realm of context-based learning and observed several behavioral markers of hierarchical RL, such as asymmetric switch costs between changes in higher-level versus lower-level features, faster learning in higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts, and preference for higher-valued compared to lower-valued contexts. We replicated these results across three independent samples. We simulated three models{\textemdash}a classic RL, a hierarchical RL, and a hierarchical Bayesian model{\textemdash}and compared their behavior to human results. While the flat RL model captured some aspects of participants' sensitivity to outcome values, and the hierarchical Bayesian model captured some markers of transfer, only hierarchical RL accounted for all patterns observed in human behavior. This work shows that hierarchical RL, a biologically inspired and computationally simple algorithm, can capture human behavior in complex, hierarchical environments and opens the avenue for future research in this field.},

Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction, two issues that are particularly damaging for the study of multifaceted constructs like self-regulation. Here, we derive a psychological ontology from a study of individual differences across a broad range of behavioral tasks, self-report surveys, and self-reported real-world outcomes associated with self-regulation. Though both tasks and surveys putatively measure self-regulation, they show little empirical relationship. Within tasks and surveys, however, the ontology identifies reliable individual traits and reveals opportunities for theoretic synthesis. We then evaluate predictive power of the psychological measurements and find that while surveys modestly and heterogeneously predict real-world outcomes, tasks largely do not. We conclude that self-regulation lacks coherence as a construct, and that data-driven ontologies lay the groundwork for a cumulative psychological science.},

  abstract = {When different perceptual signals of the same physical property are integrated, for example, an objects' size, which can be seen and felt, they form a more reliable sensory estimate (e.g., M. O. Ernst \& M. S. Banks, 2002). This, however, implies that the sensory system already knows which signals belong together and how they relate. In other words, the system has to know the mapping between the signals. In a Bayesian model of cue integration, this prior knowledge can be made explicit. Here, we ask whether such a mapping between two arbitrary sensory signals from vision and touch can be learned from their statistical co-occurrence such that they become integrated. In the Bayesian framework, this means changing the belief about the distribution of the stimuli. To this end, we trained subjects with stimuli that are usually unrelated in the world--the luminance of an object (visual signal) and its stiffness (haptic signal). In the training phase, we then presented subjects with combinations of these two signals, which were artificially correlated, and thus, we introduced a new mapping between them. For example, the stiffer the object, the brighter it was. We measured the influence of learning by comparing discrimination performance before and after training. The prediction is that integration makes discrimination worse for stimuli, which are incongruent with the newly learned mapping, because integration would cause this incongruency to disappear perceptually. The more certain subjects are about the new mapping, the stronger should the influence be on discrimination performance. Thus, learning in this context is about acquiring beliefs. We found a significant change in discrimination performance before and after training when comparing trials with congruent and incongruent stimuli. After training, discrimination thresholds for the incongruent stimuli are increased relative to thresholds for congruent stimuli, suggesting that subjects learned effectively to integrate the two formerly unrelated signals.},

  abstract = {The ``Law of Practice'' {\textendash} a simple nonlinear function describing the relationship between mean response time (RT) and practice {\textendash} has provided a practically and theoretically useful way of quantifying the speed-up that characterizes skill acquisition. Early work favored a power law, but this was shown to be an artifact of biases caused by averaging over participants who are individually better described by an exponential law. However, both power and exponential functions make the strong assumption that the speedup always proceeds at a steadily decreasing rate, even though there are sometimes clear exceptions. We propose a new law that can both accommodate an initial delay resulting in a slower-faster-slower rate of learning, with either power or exponential forms as limiting cases, and which can account for not only mean RT but also the effect of practice on the entire distribution of RT. We evaluate this proposal with data from a broad array of tasks using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, which pools data across participants while minimizing averaging artifacts, and using inference procedures that take into account differences in flexibility among laws. In a clear majority of paradigms our results supported a delayed exponential law.},

  abstract = {Individual differences have not often been considered within the problemsolving or concept-learning literatures despite the indication that some individuals are better able to transfer to novel problems and that manipulations in strategy can effectively increase the ability to transfer (Gick \& Holyoak, 1983). Research in the function-learning domain indicates that there may be two qualitatively different types of learners: those who remember distinct example associations (exemplar learners) and others who abstract rules that govern each association (rule learners; DeLosh, Busemeyer, \& McDaniel, 1997). Data from two unpublished studies (McDaniel, Cahill, Robbins, \& Trumpower, 2012; Fadler, Lee, Scullin, Shelton, \& McDaniel, 2012) have demonstrated the stability of these two types of learning across a variety of different higher order problem-solving, concept-learning, and cognitive tasks. However, it remains to be seen whether these differences between learners have implications for the type of conceptual material often used in classrooms.  In the current project, this issue was addressed through two experiments. During Experiment 1, participants were first identified as exemplar or rule-based learners on the basis of function learning transfer performance. Each group then read several passages and answered questions about the passages that ranged in their degree of transfer. Rule learners performed better than exemplar learners on each question type and the two types of learners also demonstrated qualitatively different processing during function learning training  iii and on a test of analogical transfer. The data from Experiment 2 showed that rule learners behaved qualitatively differently from exemplar learners during function learning training but failed to replicate the passage data from Experiment 1. However, a benefit was found on recognition memory for exemplar learners on a concept-learning task.  The current study is the first to show differential benefits for exemplar and rule-based processing. It also provides evidence that function-learning tendency can be used to predict differences on concept-learning tasks and that only rule learning is associated with abstraction ability. The findings suggest that individual differences should be considered both in current hybrid models of categorization, but also potentially in classrooms that might rely heavily on problem solving, where the differences in types of learners may have an impact on student performance and understanding},

Because they were not familiar with the environment, they needed to learn its characteristics from experience to plan optimally. Later in the task, we randomly blocked the optimal path to investigate whether and how people adjust their original plans to find a detour. To this end, we developed and compared 12 different models. These models were different on how they learned and represented the environment and how they planned to catch the goal. The majority of our participants were able to plan optimally. We also showed that people were capable of revising their plans when an unexpected event occurred. The result from the model comparison showed that the model-based reinforcement learning approach provided the best account for the data and outperformed heuristics in explaining the behavioral data in the re-planning trials.},

  abstract = {If our choices make us who we are, then what does that mean when these choices are made in the human-machine interface? Developing a clear understanding of how human decision making is influenced by automated systems in the environment is critical because, as human-machine interfaces and assistive robotics become even more ubiquitous in everyday life, many daily decisions will be an emergent result of the interactions between the human and the machine {\textendash} not stemming solely from the human. For example, choices can be influenced by the relative locations and motor costs of the response options, as well as by the timing of the response prompts. In drift diffusion model simulations of response-prompt timing manipulations, we find that it is only relatively equibiased choices that will be successfully influenced by this kind of perturbation. However, with drift diffusion model simulations of motor cost manipulations, we find that even relatively biased choices can still show some influence of the perturbation. We report the results of a two-alternative forced-choice experiment with a computer mouse modified to have a subtle velocity bias in a pre-determined direction for each trial, inducing an increased motor cost to move the cursor away from the pre-designated target direction. With queries that have each been normed in advance to be equibiased in people's preferences, the participant will often begin their mouse movement before their cognitive choice has been finalized, and the directional bias in the mouse velocity exerts a small but significant influence on their final choice. With queries that are not equibiased, a similar influence is observed. By exploring the synergies that are developed between humans and machines and tracking their temporal dynamics, this work aims to provide insight into our evolving decisions.},

Prior work has found that the inclusion of graphs makes messages about scientific data more persuasive (Tal \& Wansink, 2016). One explanation for this finding is that such visualizations evoke the notion of ``science''; however, results are mixed. In the current investigation we extend this work by examining whether graphs lead people to erroneously infer causation from correlational data. In two experiments we gave participants realistic online news articles in which they were asked to evaluate the research and apply the work's findings to a real-life hypothetical scenario. Participants were assigned to read the text of the article alone or with an accompanying line or bar graph. We found no evidence that the presence of graphs affected participants' evaluations of correlational data as causal. Given that these findings were unexpected, we attempted to directly replicate a well-cited article making the claim that graphs are persuasive (Tal \& Wansink, 2016), but we were unsuccessful. Overall, our results suggest that the mere presence of graphs does not necessarily increase the likelihood that one infers incorrect causal claims.

We investigated whether stimulus diversity{\textendash}an important principle of category-based induc\- tion{\textendash}influences fear generalization. Induction studies have shown that generalization from a premise involving diverse instances is stronger than that from non-diverse instances. We adopted this framework for fear learning and established two groups. The diverse group developed fear in response to diverse instances from one category, while the non-diverse group acquired fear of non-diverse instances from the same category. An effect of stimulus diversity was observed in shock-expectancy ratings, with the diverse group displaying higher fear generalization than the non-diverse group. We also tested whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) might affect the difference in fear generalization between the two conditions. Individuals with higher IU showed reduced difference in fear generalization between two conditions, mainly driven by heightened fear generalization to novel stimulus with ambiguous threat levels in the non-diverse condition. This study helps illustrate the mechanisms behind dif\- ferential category-based fear generalization and provides a potential explanation for why higher IU individuals may develop anxiety disorders following trauma.},

The models are developed by synthesizing mental-architecture, random-walk, and decision-bound approaches. According to the models, people make independent decisions about the locations of stimuli along a set of component dimensions. Those independent decisions are then combined via logical rules to determine the overall categorization response. The time course of the independent decisions is modeled via random-walk processes operating along individual dimensions. Alternative mental architectures are used as mechanisms for combining the independent decisions to implement the logical rules. We derive fundamental qualitative contrasts for distinguishing among the predictions of the rule models and major alternative models of classification RT. We also use the models to predict detailed RT distribution data associated with individual stimuli in tasks of speeded perceptual classification.},

Previous findings are inconclusive as to whether higher working memory capacity (WMC) is always associated with using more accurate prediction strategies, or whether higher WMC can also be associated with using overly complex strategies that do not improve accuracy. In this study, participants predicted a range of systematically varied nonlinear processes based on exponential functions where prediction accuracy could or could not be enhanced using well-calibrated rules. Results indicate that higher WMC participants seem to rely more on well-calibrated strategies, leading to more accurate predictions for processes with highly nonlinear trajectories in the prediction region. Predictions of lower WMC participants, in contrast, point toward an increased use of simple exemplar-based prediction strategies, which perform just as well as more complex strategies when the prediction region is approximately linear. These results imply that with respect to predicting dynamic processes, working memory capacity limits are not generally a strength or a weakness, but that this depends on the process to be predicted.},

In this context, the old debate on whether learning occurs by the gradual formation of associations or by occasional shifts between hypotheses representing beliefs about distal states of the world has resurfaced. Gallistel et al. (2014) pitched the two theories against each other in a nonstationary probability learning task. They concluded that various qualitative patterns in their data were incompatible with trial-by-trial associative learning and could only be explained by a hypothesis-testing model. Here, we contest that claim and demonstrate that it was premature. First, we argue that their experimental paradigm consisted of two distinct tasks: probability tracking (an estimation task) and change detection (a decision-making task). Next, we present a model that uses the (associative) delta learning rule for the probability tracking task and bounded evidence accumulation for the change detection task. We find that this combination of two highly established theories accounts well for all qualitative phenomena and outperforms the alternative model proposed by Gallistel et al. (2014) in a quantitative model comparison. In the spirit of cumulative science, we conclude that current experimental data on human learning of nonstationary probabilities can be explained as a combination of associative learning and bounded evidence accumulation and does not require a new model.

For half of those constructs, the four `mid-term' exams repeatedly asked the same question (Constant condition). For the other half, each of those exams asked about the constructs via a new question (Varied condition). The final exam included both repeated and novel items testing each construct. We utilized explanatory item response models to examine whether students' performance on the final exam (the probability of a particular student correctly answering a particular item) depends on the type of question (Constant or Varied) previously asked about that construct and on aptitude.

  abstract = {Response dynamics, including but not limited to mouse-tracking, is a robust process-tracing method that provides a continuous window into cognition across many domains, from linguistic processing to preferential choice. With the increased popularity of movement tracking, several inferential statistical tests have been proposed, although most summarize each trajectory into a single value. Such point values lose the rich temporal dynamics of individual trajectories. We employed a state of the art statistical analysis, Gaussian process regression modeling, to analyze mouse tracking data using a functional version of repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Employing this method, we analyzed full movement trajectories while preserving temporal dynamics, accounting for subject and condition variability. We applied this method to preferential choice data between gambles of varying riskiness from Koop and Johnson (2013), as well as a follow up risky decision-making task where responses were made with three different input devices: a standard computer mouse, a laptop trackpad, and a Wiimote. By using functional ANOVA, we captured variation due to riskiness across full trajectories and demonstrated an approach for inferring differences across conditions. Both studies taken together help to validate and advance a novel method for analyzing mouse-tracking data. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

Episodic memory retrieval has been widely studied during ageing, whereas learning has received less attention. Here we examined the neural correlates of episodic learning rate in ageing. Our study sample consisted of 982 cognitively healthy female and male older participants from the Vallecas Project cohort, without a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The learning rate across the three consecutive recall trials of the verbal memory task (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) recall trials was used as a predictor of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume using voxel-based morphometry, and WM microstructure using tract-based spatial statistics on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) measures. Immediate Recall improved by 1.4 items per trial on average, and this episodic learning rate was faster in women and negatively associated with age. Structurally, hippocampal and anterior thalamic GM volume correlated positively with learning rate. Learning also correlated with the integrity of WM microstructure (high FA and low MD) in an extensive network of tracts including bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, fornix, and long-range tracts. These results suggest that episodic learning rate is associated with key anatomical structures for memory functioning, motivating further exploration of the differential diagnostic properties between episodic learning rate and retrieval in ageing.},

  abstract = {Performance on verbal and mathematical tasks is enhanced when participants shift from using algorithms to retrieving information directly from memory (Siegler, 1988a). However, it is unknown whether a shift to retrieval is involved in dynamic spatial skill acquisition. For example, do athletes mentally extrapolate the trajectory of the ball, or do they retrieve the future location from memory? To examine this question, 2 experiments were conducted using a task paradigm similar to the game Pong{\textemdash}a ball was launched from 1 side of the screen and participants attempted to position a paddle to intercept the ball. In Experiment 1, participants responded to a limited number of repeated trajectories. During the learning phase, the response deadline was near the paddle. During the difficult phase, the response deadline was closer to the launch point. During the critical phase, novel trajectories were introduced at the difficult response deadline. If participants are using a retrieval strategy by the critical phase, performance should be significantly worse on the novel trajectories, whereas if they are using an algorithmic strategy, performance on the novel trials should be similar to performance on the repeated trajectories. In Experiment 2, half the participants followed an experimental paradigm similar to Experiment 1 and half experienced all novel trajectories throughout the task. Our results were consistent with a shift from algorithmic processing to retrieval{\textemdash}participants performed significantly better on repeated trajectories relative to novel trajectories. Furthermore, retrieval strategies enhance performance above and beyond what is gained by practicing the algorithm alone.},

Prior research and theories of skill acquisition suggest that individuals engage in item-specific retrieval shifts (Anglim \& Wynton, 2015; Logan, 1988; Palmeri, 1997; Rickard, 1997, 2004; Touron, 2006; Wilkins \& Rawson, 2010). However, this prior research examined performance on nonspatial, nondynamic tasks. In three experiments, we pitted four hypotheses against each other, to test skill acquisition for intercepting repeated trajectories in a spatial and dynamic task: the item-specific algorithmic speedup hypothesis, the item-specific retrieval shift hypothesis, the collective retrieval shift hypothesis, and the combined hypothesis (item-specific algorithmic speedup followed by a collective retrieval shift). We found evidence for the combined hypothesis. Specifically, under easy conditions, we found small improvements on repeated trajectories that were attributable to item-specific algorithmic speedup. By contrast, under difficult conditions, we found strong evidence that the performance benefits for repeated trajectories were driven primarily by a collective shift from algorithmic to directretrieval strategies. This evidence for collective retrieval shift is in direct contrast to theories suggesting item-specific retrieval shifts. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

On each trial, a subject is presented with a stimulus configuration indicating the value of four medical symptoms. The subject responds by guessing which of two diseases is present and is then given feedback about which disease was actually present. The feedback is determined according to fixed conditional probabilities unknown to the subject. We test a normative Bayesian model as well as simple variants of well-known psychological models including the Fuzzy Logical Model of Perception, an Exemplar model, a two-layer Connectionist model and an ALCOVE model. Both the asymptotic predictions of these models (i.e., predictions regarding behavior after it has stabilized and learning is complete) and predictions of trial-by-trial changes in behavior are tested. The models are tested against existing data from Estes et al. (1989, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, \& Cognition,15, 556-571) and new data from medical diagnosis tasks that include not only asymmetric but also symmetric base rates. Learning was observed in all cases in that subjects tended to match the objective probabilities of the symptom configurations more closely in later trials. All of the descriptive models give a more accurate account of performance than the normative Bayesian model. Relative to a benchmark measure, however, none of these models does an especially good job of characterizing asymptotic performance or the learning process. We suggest that future experiments should address individual performance, rather than group learning curves.},

  abstract = {The goal of training is to produce learning for a range of activities that are typically more general than the training task itself. Despite a century of research, predicting the scope of learning from the content of training has proven extremely difficult, with the same task producing narrowly focused learning strategies in some cases and broadly scoped learning strategies in others. Here we test the hypothesis that human subjects will prefer a decision strategy that maximizes performance and reduces uncertainty given the demands of the training task and that the strategy chosen will then predict the extent to which learning is transferable. To test this hypothesis, we trained subjects on a moving dot extrapolation task that makes distinct predictions for two types of learning strategy: a narrow model-free strategy that learns an input-output mapping for training stimuli, and a general model-based strategy that utilizes humans' default predictive model for a class of trajectories. When the number of distinct training trajectories is low, we predict better performance for the mapping strategy, but as the number increases, a predictive model is increasingly favored. Consonant with predictions, subject extrapolations for test trajectories were consistent with using a mapping strategy when trained on a small number of training trajectories and a predictive model when trained on a larger number. The general framework developed here can thus be useful both in interpreting previous patterns of task-specific versus task-general learning, as well as in building future training paradigms with certain desired outcomes.},

Yet, a thorough understanding of transfer has been frustratingly elusive, with some researchers arguing that meaningful transfer rarely occurs or attempts to detect transfer are futile. In spite of this pessimism, we explore a model-based account of transfer. Building on the laws of practice, we develop a scalable, quantitative framework to detect transfer (or lack thereof). We perform a simulation study to explore under what conditions under which transfer can be detected and model parameters can be faithfully recovered. We then use our modeling framework to explore a large-scale game-play dataset from Lumosity. Our results suggest there are conditions in which transfer is more easily detected and there is evidence of specific game-to-game transfer in the Lumosity data.},

We analyze the performance development with the goal to test the adequacy of learning curves, and the skill acquisition theories they are based on, for describing and predicting expertise acquisition. On the one hand, we show that the skill acquisition theories implying a negative exponential learning curve do a better job in both describing early performance gains and predicting later trajectories of chess performance than those theories implying a power function learning curve. On the other hand, the learning curves of a large proportion of players show systematic qualitative deviations from the predictions of either type of skill acquisition theory. While skill acquisition theories predict larger performance gains in early years and smaller gains in later years, a substantial number of players begin to show substantial improvements with a delay of several years (and no improvement in the first years), deviations not fully accounted for by quantity of practice.

We find that, across multiple different function families, people make informative sampling choices consistent with a simple, low-effort policy that minimizes uncertainty at extreme values without requiring adaptation to evidence. While participants were most accurate at learning linear functions, those who more closely adhered to the simple sampling strategy also made better predictions across all non-linear functions.

Studies challenging this idea have demonstrated that feature binding can happen outside of the focus of attention for familiar objects, as well as for arbitrary color-orientation conjunctions. Detection performance for arbitrary feature conjunction improves with training, suggesting a potential role of perceptual learning mechanisms in the integration of features, a process called ``binding-learning''. In the present study, we investigate whether stimulus variability and task relevance, two critical determinants of visual perceptual learning, also modulate binding-learning. Transfer of learning in a visual search task to a pre-exposed color-orientation conjunction was assessed under conditions of varying stimulus variability and task relevance. We found transfer of learning for the pre-exposed feature conjunctions that were trained with high variability (Experiment 1). Transfer of learning was not observed when the conjunction was rendered taskirrelevant during training due to pop-out targets (Experiment 2). Our findings show that feature binding is determined by principles of perceptual learning, and they support the idea that functions traditionally attributed to goal-driven attention can be grounded in the learning of the statistical structure of the environment.},

  abstract = {Why, when, and how do stereotypes change? This paper develops a computational account based on the principles of structure learning: stereotypes are governed by probabilistic beliefs about the assignment of individuals to groups. Two aspects of this account are particularly important. First, groups are flexibly constructed based on the distribution of traits across individuals; groups are not fixed, nor are they assumed to map on to categories we have to provide to the model. This allows the model to explain the phenomena of group discovery and subtyping, whereby deviant individuals are segregated from a group, thus protecting the group's stereotype. Second, groups are hierarchically structured, such that groups can be nested. This allows the model to explain the phenomenon of subgrouping, whereby a collection of deviant individuals is organized into a refinement of the superordinate group. The structure learning account also sheds light on several factors that determine stereotype change, including perceived group variability, individual typicality, cognitive load, and sample size.},

However, little research has attempted to apply a dual-task paradigm to function learning. The present thesis aims to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between working memory and function learning behaviour. Eighty Carleton University students were randomly assigned to learn either a linear or bilinear function. Moreover, participants were randomly assigned to complete training and transfer under either single- or dual-task conditions. It was hypothesized that the secondary task would hinder performance resulting in a dependency on exemplar-based learning. Using a novel classification approach, the results showed that the secondary task reduced the stability of learning approach. However, the results remain inconclusive due to low power. Therefore, additional research is required to determine whether dual-task paradigms can be used to distinguish between rule- and exemplar-based processing in function learning.},

To investigate the representation and plasticity of the visuomotor coordinate transformation, we examined the changes in pointing behavior after local visuomotor remappings. The visual feedback of finger position was limited to one or two locations in the workspace, at which a discrepancy was introduced between the actual and visually perceived finger position. These remappings induced changes in pointing, which were largest near the locus of remapping and decreased away from it. This pattern of spatial generalization highly constrains models of the computation of the visuomotor transformation in the CNS. A simple model, in which the transformation is computed via the population activity of a set of units with large sensory receptive fields, is shown to capture the observed pattern.},

We explore the possibility that the human motor system uses such a modular decomposition strategy to learn the visuomotor map, the relationship between visual inputs and motor outputs. Using a virtual reality system, subjects were exposed to opposite prism-like visuomotor remappings-discrepancies between actual and visually perceived hand locations- for movements starting from two distinct locations. Despite this conflicting pairing between visual and motor space, subjects learned the two starting-point-dependent visuomotor mappings and the generalization of this learning to intermediate starting locations demonstrated an interpolation of the two learned maps. This interpolation was a weighted average of the two learned visuomotor mappings, with the weighting sigmoidally dependent on starting location, a prediction made by a computational model of modular learning known as the "mixture of experts". These results provide evidence that the brain may employ a modular decomposition strategy during learning.},

  abstract = {Background High talker variability (i.e., multiple voices in the input) has been found effective in training nonnative phonetic contrasts in adults. A small number of studies suggest that children also benefit from high-variability phonetic training with some evidence that they show greater learning (more plasticity) than adults given matched input, although results are mixed. However, no study has directly compared the effectiveness of high versus low talker variability in children. Methods Native Greek-speaking eight-year-olds (N = 52), and adults (N = 41) were exposed to the English /i/-/ɪ/ contrast in 10 training sessions through a computerized word-learning game. Pre- and post-training tests examined discrimination of the contrast as well as lexical learning. Participants were randomly assigned to high (four talkers) or low (one talker) variability training conditions. Results Both age groups improved during training, and both improved more while trained with a single talker. Results of a three-interval oddity discrimination test did not show the predicted benefit of high-variability training in either age group. Instead, children showed an effect in the reverse direction{\textemdash}i.e., reliably greater improvements in discrimination following single talker training, even for untrained generalization items, although the result is qualified by (accidental) differences between participant groups at pre-test. Adults showed a numeric advantage for high-variability but were inconsistent with respect to voice and word novelty. In addition, no effect of variability was found for lexical learning. There was no evidence of greater plasticity for phonetic learning in child learners. Discussion This paper adds to the handful of studies demonstrating that, like adults, child learners can improve their discrimination of a phonetic contrast via computerized training. There was no evidence of a benefit of training with multiple talkers, either for discrimination or word learning. The results also do not support the findings of greater plasticity in child learners found in a previous paper (Giannakopoulou, Uther \& Ylinen, 2013a). We discuss these results in terms of various differences between training and test tasks used in the current work compared with previous literature.},

A large body of work in machine learning has investigated how learning can exploit both labeled and unlabeled data provided to a learner. Using equivalences between models found in human categorization and machine learning research, we explain how these semi-supervised techniques can be applied to human learning. A series of experiments are described which show that semi-supervised learning models prove useful for explaining human behavior when exposed to both labeled and unlabeled data. We then discuss some machine learning models that do not have familiar human categorization counterparts. Finally, we discuss some challenges yet to be addressed in the use of semi-supervised models for modeling human categorization.},

Yet there is ambiguity in how to interpret this analogy, due to a lack of concrete empirical comparisons. Using data from n\,=\,281 participants ages 5 to 55, we show that cooling off does not only apply to the single dimension of randomness. Rather, human development resembles an optimization process of multiple learning parameters, for example, reward generalization, uncertainty-directed exploration and random temperature. Rapid changes in parameters occur during childhood, but these changes plateau and converge to efficient values in adulthood. We show that while the developmental trajectory of human parameters is strikingly similar to several stochastic optimization algorithms, there are important differences in convergence. None of the optimization algorithms tested were able to discover reliably better regions of the strategy space than adult participants on this task.},

Self-organizing maps are psychologically and biologically plausible neural network models that can learn after limited exposure to positive category examples, without any need of contrastive information. Just like humans. They reproduce human behavior in category generalization, in particular the Numerosity and Variability effects, which are usually explained with Bayesian tools. Where category generalization is concerned, self-organizing maps deserve attention to bridge the gap between the computational level of analysis in Marr's hierarchy (where Bayesian models are often situated) and the algorithmic level of analysis in which plausible mechanisms are described.},

Often relational categories have correlated (but nonessential) surface features, which can be a distraction from discovering the category-defining relations, preventing knowledge transfer. This is one explanation for ``the inert knowledge problem'' in education wherein many students fail to spontaneously apply their learning outside the classroom. Here we present a series of experiments using artificial categories that correlate surface features and relational patterns during learning. Our goal was to determine what task parameters and individual differences in learners shift focus to the relational aspect of the category and foster transfer to novel disparate exemplars. We consistently showed that the effectiveness of task structure manipulations (e.g., the sequence of learning exemplars) depended on the learners' strategies (e.g., whether learners are oriented toward discovering rules or focusing on exemplars). Further, we found support that ``inference-learning,'' wherein learners are presented with incomplete exemplars and learn how to infer the missing pieces, is an effective way to promote relational discovery and transfer, even for learners who are not predisposed to make such discoveries.},

The force output was successfully specified from information in memory related to the weight of common objects, because only small changes in the force-rate profiles occurred across 10 consecutive lifts. This information was retrieved during a process related to visual identification of the target object. 3. The amount of practice necessary to appropriately scale the vertical lifting and grip (pinch) force was also studied when novel objects (equipped with force transducers at the grip surfaces) of different densities were encountered. The mass of a test object that subjects had not seen previously was adjusted to either 300 or 1,000 g by inserting an appropriate mass in the object's base without altering its appearance. This resulted in either a density that was in the range of most common objects (1.2 kg/l) or a density that was unusually high (4.0 kg/l). 4. Low vertical-lifting and grip-force rates were used initially with the high-density object, as if a lighter object had been expected. However, within the first few trials, the duration of the loading phase (period of isometric force increase before lift-off) was reduced by nearly 50\% and the employed force-rate profiles were targeted for the weight of the object.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Exposing learners to variability during training has been demonstrated to improve performance in subsequent transfer testing. Such variability benefits are often accounted for by assuming that learners are developing some general task schema or structure. However much of this research has neglected to account for differences in similarity between varied and constant training conditions. In a between-groups manipulation, we trained participants on a simple projectile launching task, with either varied or constant conditions. We replicate previous findings showing a transfer advantage of varied over constant training. Furthermore, we show that a standard similarity model is insufficient to account for the benefits of variation, but, if the model is adjusted to assume that varied learners are tuned towards a broader generalization gradient, then a similarity-based model is sufficient to explain the observed benefits of variation. Our results therefore suggest that some variability benefits can be accommodated within instance-based models without positing the learning of some schemata or structure.},

  abstract = {The importance of proportional reasoning has long been recognized by psychologists and educators, yet we still do not have a good understanding of how humans mentally represent proportions. In this paper we present a psychophysical model of proportion estimation, extending previous approaches. We assumed that proportion representations are formed by representing each magnitude of a proportion stimuli (the part and its complement) as Gaussian activations in the mind, which are then mentally combined in the form of a proportion. We next derived the internal representation of proportions, including bias and internal noise parameters -capturing respectively how our estimations depart from true values and how variable estimations are. Methodologically, we introduced a mixture of components to account for contaminating behaviors (guessing and reversal of responses) and framed the model in a hierarchical way. We found empirical support for the model by testing a group of 4th grade children in a spatial proportion estimation task. In particular, the internal density reproduced the asymmetries (skewedness) seen in this and in previous reports of estimation tasks, and the model accurately described wide variations between subjects in behavior. Bias estimates were in general smaller than by using previous approaches, due to the model's capacity to absorb contaminating behaviors. This property of the model can be of especial relevance for studies aimed at linking psychophysical measures with broader cognitive abilities. We also recovered higher levels of noise than those reported in discrimination of spatial magnitudes and discuss possible explanations for it. We conclude by illustrating a concrete application of our model to study the effects of scaling in proportional reasoning, highlighting the value of quantitative models in this field of research.},

Participants learned categories determined by a disjunctive rule with relational features through a feedback training procedure. During training, participants responded to strategy probes following each block to provide online assessment of the extent to which rule- and exemplar-based strategies were used throughout the training period. We introduced this measure as an alternative to model-based approaches to assessing individual differences in strategy use during training. Following training, participants classified ambiguous transfer objects that were assumed to distinguish between earlier use of rule- and exemplar-based learning strategies. We included this measure to obtain a relatively objective index of strategy use during training. Next, participants provided global ratings of their use of rule- and exemplar-based strategies during training. Results showed that strategy preferences expressed on the final training block predicted categorisation of ambiguous transfer objects better than global strategy reports. In addition, we utilised the block-by-block strategy reports to investigate the dynamics of learners' strategy preferences over the course of training. The findings revealed greater fluidity in strategy preferences for both younger and older adults than has been previously documented in the category learning literature. The novel block-by-block strategy reports in conjunction with the transfer-based approach allowed for a more nuanced examination of individual and age differences in strategy use and categorisation performance.},

Analysis showed the superiority of practice over no practice, variable over specific practice, and random over blocked variability for transfer with two 'out of range' dimensions. Accuracy decayed between the transfer tests. These results are consistent with schema theory, and it is recommended that physical education teachers should focus variable practice on task dimensions that are new to their classes.},

Older adults were impaired in applying the negative slope concept. However, there was no relative deficit in switching between the negative and positive function slopes or inverting the learned relationship.

The stability of extrapolation performance was assessed in Experiment 1 across three transfer tasks using experience with novel stimuli, in Experiment 2 where similarity to training stimuli was reduced for a subset of novel stimuli, and in Experiment 3 where a subset of novel stimuli were relatively more abstract than training stimuli. Individuals were first classified to type (i.e., rule or exemplar) based on one test of extrapolation using a performance criterion. Then the stability of extrapolation behavior was appraised along the dimensions of performance characteristics and empirical stability, both between and within the two types. Performance characteristics of each type were defined as extrapolation of the function relationship for rule use and limited extrapolation for exemplar use. Empirical stability was defined statistically by comparisons of performance within types and differences between types, after classification. Across the three experiments, the rule type, with limited exceptions, extrapolated the function. The exemplar type exhibited a mixture of extrapolation performance. These results were evaluated in terms of the possible performance outcomes of: type stability across experience, instability across experience, or adaptability across contexts.

This study utilized an artificial language paradigm to examine the contribution of item variability to the learning of these types of dependencies. Adult subjects with and without language-based learning disabilities listened to strings of three non-words for which the first and third elements had a dependent relationship. In the low variability condition, 12 non-words occurred in the middle position, and in the high variability condition, 24 non-words occurred in this position. Non-disabled adults were able to learn the non-adjacent contingencies and generalize the underlying structure to new strings, but only when variability was high. Adults with language-based learning disabilities did not perform above chance levels under either variability condition. Thus, this group showed poor sensitivity to statistical information in speech input that both infants and non-disabled adults are known to track. LEARNING OUTCOMES: As a result of this activity, the reader will: (1) understand the advantages of using an artificial language to investigate language learning; (2) become familiar with a paradigm for studying the rapid learning of syntactic contingencies; (3) comprehend how the ability to map language structure differs for non-disabled adults and adults with a history of language/learning disability as a function of variability in the input the listener receives.},

  abstract = {The overall aim with the thesis was to investigate how learning to pursue two conflicting goals (cost and utility) in an electricity consumption task is affected by different forms of feedback, goal phrasing, and task environment. Applied research investigating the efficiency of outcome feedback on electricity consumption via in-home displays points at modest reductions (2-4\%). Further, a wealth of cognitive psychological research shows that learning with outcome feedback is not unproblematic. A new experimental paradigm, the simulated household, that captures the cognitive task that confronts people when trying to regulate their electricity consumption, was developed. In three studies, different aspects of the problem of regulating one's consumption was investigated. Study I, investigated how different feedback in terms of frequency, detail, and presence of random noise or not affect performance. It also investigated if participants pursued the goals sequentially or simultaneously and if they were able to derive a model of the task. Results showed that frequent feedback was beneficial only in a deterministic system and, surprisingly, random noise improved performance by highlighting the most costly appliances. Modelling results indicated that participants pursued goals sequentially and did not have a mental model of the task. Study II, investigated if a short feedforward training could replace or complement outcome feedback. Results indicated that the performance with one of the feedforward training schemes lead to comparable performance to outcome feedback only. The best performance was obtained when this feedforward scheme was combined with outcome feedback. Study III, investigated if the sequential goal pursuit observed in Study I was related to interpretation of the task or cognitive limitations by specifying goals for cost and/ or utility. Further, it investigated the reason for the cost prioritisation. Results indicated that the sequential goal pursuit derives from cognitive constraints. Together, the results from the studies suggest that people pursue the goals sequentially and that instant outcome feedback may harm performance by distracting people from the most important and costly appliances to the appliances that allow large variability in use.

In three visual search experiments, the time course of target{\textendash}distractor similarity effects and distractor{\textendash}distractor similarity effects was examined. A version of the extended generalized context model (EGCM; Lamberts, 1998) provided a good account of the time course of the observed similarity effects, supporting the notion that similarity in search is dynamic. Modeling also indicated that increasing distractor homogeneity influences both perceptual and decision processes by (respectively) increasing the rate at which stimulus features are processed and enabling strategic weighting of stimulus information.

  abstract = {Sensorimotor systems face complex and frequent discrepancies among spatial modalities, for example, growth, optical distortion, and telemanipulation. Adaptive mechanisms must act continuously to restore perceptual-motor alignments necessary for perception of a coherent world. Experimental manipulations that exposed participants to localized discrepancies showed that adaptation is revealed by the acquisition of a constrained relation between entire modalities rather than associations between individual exemplars within these modalities. The computational problem faced by the human nervous system can thus be conceived as having to induce constrained relations between continuous stimulus and response dimensions from ambiguous or incomplete training sets, that is, performing interpolation and extrapolation. How biological neuronal networks solve this problem is unknown. Here we show that neural processing based on linear collective computation and least-square (LS) error learning in populations of frequency-coded neurons (i.e., whose discharge varies in a monotonic fashion with a parameter) has built-in interpolation and extrapolation capacities. This model can account for the properties of perceptual-motor adaptations in sensorimotor systems.},

However, the negative effects of noise are not universal. In this paper, we examine how people learn sequential control strategies given different sources and amounts of feedback variability. In particular, we consider people's behavior in a task where short- and long-term rewards are placed in conflict (i.e., the best option in the short-term is worst in the long-term). Consistent with a model based on reinforcement learning principles [Gureckis, T., \& Love, B.C. Short term gains, long term pains: How cues about state aid learning in dynamic environments. Cognition (in press)], we find that learners differentially weight information predictive of the current task state. In particular, when cues that signal state are noisy, we find that participants' ability to identify an optimal strategy is strongly impaired relative to equivalent amounts of noise that obscure the rewards/valuations of those states. In other situations, we find that noise and noise in reward signals may paradoxically improve performance by encouraging exploration. Our results demonstrate how experimentally-manipulated task variability can be used to test predictions about the mechanisms that learners engage in dynamic decision making tasks.},

But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop or any other task? We highlight three qualitatively different effects: negative effects, null effects, and positive effects. The main goal of this paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there individuals with truly no effect? Are there any individuals with negative effects? We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below and above threshold for different people. We show that most tasks people are quite alike{\textemdash}for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails to Stroop or Stroops negatively.

Recently, we introduced a billiards paradigm and demonstrated the feasibility of real-world-neuroscience using wearables for naturalistic full-body motion-tracking and mobile-brain-imaging. Here we developed an embodied virtual-reality (VR) environment to our real-world billiards paradigm, which allows to control the visual feedback for this complex real-world task, while maintaining sense of embodiment. The setup was validated by comparing real-world ball trajectories with the trajectories of the virtual balls, calculated by the physics engine. We then ran our short-term motor learning protocol in the embodied VR. Subjects played billiard shots when they held the physical cue and hit a physical ball on the table while seeing it all in VR. We found comparable short-term motor learning trends in the embodied VR to those we previously reported in the physical real-world task. Embodied VR can be used for learning real-world tasks in a highly controlled environment which enables applying visual manipulations, common in laboratory-tasks and rehabilitation, to a real-world full-body task. Embodied VR enables to manipulate feedback and apply perturbations to isolate and assess interactions between specific motor-learning components, thus enabling addressing the current questions of motor-learning in real-world tasks. Such a setup can potentially be used for rehabilitation, where VR is gaining popularity but the transfer to the real-world is currently limited, presumably, due to the lack of embodiment.},

Most of these studies, however, have tested this proposition under a limited amount of skill variation: generally three. We are interested in investigating if a more variable practice condition would enhance skill transfer. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of different amount of variation in variable practice in skill transfer. Undergraduate students (N=33) were randomly assigned to three groups: Constant practice; Variable practice with 3 variations; and Variable practice with 5 variations. Participants transported a tennis balls among six containers in a predefined sequence and target time. In acquisition phase, participants performed 30 trials with knowledge of results after every trial. In the transfer test, 10 trials were performed with the same sequence as in acquisition phase and a new target time, without knowledge of results. Results showed that most varied practice condition showed lower errors than the constant practice condition in transfer test. Moreover, differences among variable practice with different numbers of variations were not observed. Thus, variability of practice hypothesis was partially supported by the results of this study, since higher amounts of variations also led to a better transfer than constant practice. However, no advantages were found for the most variable practice condition when compared to the less variable condition in variable practice. New studies that investigate more complex skills and different amounts of variation in variable practice should be carried out in order to further investigate this specific issue of the variability of practice.},

Two experiments were designed that replicated and extended the experiment reported by Wulf and Schmidt (1988). In a 2 (same vs. different relative time) x 2 (blocked vs. random practice schedule) design, 48 right-handed subjects were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. A tapping task was employed that required a right-handed tap of three small brass plates arranged in a diamond pattern. Each segment had a specific time requirement. Target times and response times were provided on a computer screen directly in front of the subject. Each subject participated in two acquisition sessions (i.e., 198 practice trials) and was tested for learning on several different retention and transfer tests. In Experiment 2, a control group was added that received no acquisition phase. Results of both experiments showed a typical contextual interference effect, with depressed scores by the random groups during acquisition but significantly better scores than the blocked groups on several retention and transfer tests. Certain characteristics of the tests were found to influence the demonstration of the practice schedule effects. These results were consistent with predictions from Magill and Hall (1990) that the learning benefits of contextual interference are more likely to occur when skill variations are from different classes of movement and that the amount of variability in practice is more influential when the tobe-learned tasks are parameter modifications of the same generalized motor program.},

We conceive of induction as a dynamic process and provide the first fine-grained examination of the distribution of response times observed in inductive reasoning. We used these data to develop and empirically test the first major quantitative modeling scheme that simultaneously accounts for inductive decisions and their time course. The model assumes that knowledge of similarity relations among novel test probes and items stored in memory drive an accumulation-to-bound sequential sampling process: Test probes with high similarity to studied exemplars are more likely to trigger a generalization response, and more rapidly, than items with low exemplar similarity. We contrast data and model predictions for inductive decisions with a recognition memory task using a common stimulus set. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses across 2 experiments demonstrated that inductive reasoning and recognition memory primarily differ in the threshold to trigger a decision: Observers required less evidence to make a property generalization judgment (induction) than an identity statement about a previously studied item (recognition). Experiment 1 and a condition emphasizing decision speed in Experiment 2 also found evidence that inductive decisions use lower quality similarity-based information than recognition. The findings suggest that induction might represent a less cautious form of recognition. We conclude that sequential sampling models grounded in exemplar-based similarity, combined with hierarchical Bayesian analysis, provide a more fine-grained and informative analysis of the processes involved in inductive reasoning than is possible solely through examination of choice data.

We outline a Bayesian model and an experimental study that show that the diversity effect depends on the assumption that samples of evidence were selected by a helpful agent (strong sampling). Inductive arguments with premises containing either diverse or nondiverse evidence samples were presented under different sampling conditions, where instructions and filler items indicated that the samples were selected intentionally (strong sampling) or randomly (weak sampling). A robust diversity effect was found under strong sampling, but was attenuated under weak sampling. As predicted by our Bayesian model, the largest effect of sampling was on arguments with nondiverse evidence, where strong sampling led to more restricted generalization than weak sampling. These results show that the characteristics of evidence that are deemed relevant to an inductive reasoning problem depend on beliefs about how the evidence was generated.},

  abstract = {The act of choosing an action based on stimulus information and a set of arbitrary rules is termed response selection. It embodies the core of voluntary behavior and plays a critical role in most experimental tasks, yet the processes supporting it are poorly understood. Often, response selection is assumed to arise through the activation of stimulus-response (S-R) associations that bridge perceptual and motor processes. As others have pointed out before us, this conceptualization does little to account for many findings relating to choice response tasks. In the present chapter, we describe data from eight areas of research that bear on theories of response selection: task switching, the Hick{\textendash}Hyman law, S-R compatibility, congruency effects, dual-task performance, task configuration, learning, and memory. We then turn to neuroimaging and neurophysiological data and examine what they indicate about how stimulus information can be flexibly mapped to motor output. Across these diverse domains, the shortcomings of the simple S-R association view consistently cohere around two related properties: First, conceptual aspects of the task trump physical properties of the stimulus and responses with regard to determining the varying demands on central processes. Second, task representations are highly structured, such that some actions are more closely related than others, and these relationships affect performance. We conclude by delineating alternative theoretical frameworks that might better capture the nature of the central processes supporting response selection.},

We fit power and exponential functions to 40 sets of data representing 7,910 learning series from 475 subjects in 24 experiments.

  abstract = {This thesis develops an integrated computational model of task switching in heterogeneous categorisation by combining theories of cognitive control and category learning. The thesis considers the strengths and shortcomings of a range of existing computational accounts of categorisation (ALCOVE, SUSTAIN, ATRIUM and COVIS) by reimplementing each and applying each to human data from the categorisation literature. It is argued that most of these models cannot account for heterogeneous categorisation, i.e., situations where the category structure includes subsets with incompatible boundaries. Moreover, the only one of the four computational models that can account for heterogeneous categorisation, ATRIUM, does not completely account for the influence of top-down control during categorisation tasks. The models are also limited because they are based purely on feedforward principles, and while they are able to learn to categorise stimuli adequately, they do not account for categorisation response times, or for task-switching effects observed in recent research on heterogeneous categorisation. In order to address these limitations, the thesis presents a model that combines an interactive activation account of task-switching with a modular architecture of categorisation. The model is shown to successfully simulate reaction time costs and effects of preparation time on task switching.},

Traditionally, data are aggregated across participants and analyzed under the assumption of independently and identically distributed observations. Hierarchical Bayesian extensions of MPT models explicitly account for participant heterogeneity by assuming that the individual parameters follow a continuous hierarchical distribution. We provide an accessible introduction to hierarchical MPT modeling and present the user-friendly and comprehensive R package TreeBUGS, which implements the two most important hierarchical MPT approaches for participant heterogeneity{\textemdash}the beta-MPT approach (Smith \& Batchelder, Journal of Mathematical Psychology 54:167-183, 2010) and the latent-trait MPT approach (Klauer, Psychometrika 75:70-98, 2010). TreeBUGS reads standard MPT model files and obtains Markov-chain Monte Carlo samples that approximate the posterior distribution. The functionality and output are tailored to the specific needs of MPT modelers and provide tests for the homogeneity of items and participants, individual and group parameter estimates, fit statistics, and within- and between-subjects comparisons, as well as goodness-of-fit and summary plots. We also propose and implement novel statistical extensions to include continuous and discrete predictors (as either fixed or random effects) in the latent-trait MPT model.},

These claims recently led to the proposition of the population of linear experts model (POLE). In this paper, variations of the firefighting paradigm developed by Lewandowsky and his colleagues, which initiated research about KP, were used to explore the psychological plausibility of MOE in general and POLE in particular. In a first experiment, these statements were tested by modifying the test display of the firefighting paradigm. The results showed that adding irrelevant information to the display resulted in a smaller proportion of partitioning participants. Also, some participants used non-linear experts to partition the stimulus space. This new type of KP was further explored in a second study, which included more training sessions. The results suggest that linear KP disappears with practice and that non-linear partitioning reflects the incapacity to correctly estimate the position of the function's vertex. It is concluded that MOE are adequate psychological models, but that the linearity and ubiquity claims of the POLE model need to be weakened.},

Yet leading computational models of categorization (as exemplified by, e.g., Nosofsky, 1986) and generalization (as exemplified by, e.g., Tenenbaum \& Griffiths, 2001) make qualitatively different predictions about how inference should change as a function of the number of items. Assuming all else is equal, categorization models predict that increasing the number of items in a category increases the chance of assigning a new item to that category; generalization models predict a decrease, or category tightening with additional exemplars. This paper investigates this discrepancy, showing that people do indeed perform qualitatively differently in categorization and generalization tasks even when all superficial elements of the task are kept constant. Furthermore, the effect of category frequency on generalization is moderated by assumptions about how the items are sampled. We show that neither model naturally accounts for the pattern of behavior across both categorization and generalization tasks, and discuss theoretical extensions of these frameworks to account for the importance of category frequency and sampling assumptions.},

The observed interaction effect suggests that the training mode invites different strategies that are adjusted as a function of experience to the demands from the underlying cue?criterion structure. Thus, feedback and the intervention training modes invite cue abstraction, an effortful but successful strategy in combination with simple linear task structures, and observational training invites exemplar memory processes, a simple but successful strategy in combination with complex non-linear task structures.

  abstract = {Accurate judgments and decisions are crucial for success in many areas of human life. The accuracy of a judgment or decision depends largely on the cognitive process applied. In research on judgment, decision making, and categorization, two kinds of cognitive processes have often been contrasted: exemplar-based processes, which use similarity to previously encountered items to make judgments, decisions, and categorizations, and rule-based processes, which use abstracted cue knowledge. Although most cognitive models of judgment and decision processes assume that people rely on both processes, they differ in whether they assume that one process is selected or that both processes are blended into a single response. The present research takes a functional perspective and investigates what kind of interaction between the two processes leads to accurate responses. Based on crossvalidated simulations in real-world domains, it shows that blending rule- and exemplar-based processes generally leads to better judgments than does choosing between them, suggesting that the default strategy should be a blend of both processes, which is abandoned only when feedback justifies it.},

The prevalence of this trade-off and its neurological underpinnings led us to propose domain-general cognitive search processes (Hills, Todd, \& Goldstone, 2008). Here, we propose further that these are consistent with the idea of a central executive search process that combines goal-handling across subgoal hierarchies. The present study investigates three aspects of this proposal. First, the existence of a unitary central executive search process should allow priming from one search task to another, and at multiple hierarchical levels. We confirm this by showing cross-domain priming from a spatial search task to two different cognitive levels within a lexical search task. Second, given the neural basis of the proposed generalized cognitive search process and the evidence that the central executive is primarily engaged during complex tasks, we hypothesize that priming should require `search' in the sense of a selfregulated making and testing of sequential predictions about the world. This was confirmed by showing that when participants were allowed to collect spatial resources without searching for them, no priming occurred. Finally, we provide a mechanism for the underlying search process and investigate three alternative hypotheses for subgoal hierarchies using the Central Executive as a Search Process model (CESP). CESP envisions the central executive as having both emergent and unitary processes, with one of its roles being a generalized cognitive search process that navigates goal hierarchies by mediating persistence on and switching between subgoals.},

Within both domains, the task characteristics guiding strategy shifts are increasingly well documented. Across domains, past research has observed shifts from rule-based strategies in judgment to similarity-based strategies in categorization, but limited these comparisons to one prototypical environment, a linear task structure, and a restricted set of strategies. To systematically compare the two domains, we considered several instantiations of rule-based and similarity-based strategies and examined strategy choice across different types of judgment and categorization tasks. Between participants, we varied task characteristics from a one-dimensional linear to a multidimensional linear and to two multi-dimensional nonlinear tasks. Irrespective of domain, strategies considered, or model comparison technique used, we find that more participants relied on similarity-based strategies when the functional relationship between the cues and the criterion was nonlinear. Shifts from rule-based strategies in judgment to similarity-based strategies in categorization, however, were rare and most pronounced in one-dimensional environments. These results support the hypothesis that the cognitive strategies people select to solve a judgment or categorization task depend less on the domain but more on the complexity of the task.},

In this study, participants first learned to predict a continuous criterion based on four cues. To test the three learning mechanisms rigorously against each other, we changed the importance of the cues after 200 trials so that the mechanisms make different predictions with regard to how fast people adapt to the new environment. On average, judgment accuracy improved from Trial 1 to Trial 200, dropped when the task environment changed, but improved again until the end of the task. The capacity-restricted learning model, restricting how much people update the cue weights on a single trial, best described and predicted the learning curve of the majority of participants. Taken together, these results suggest that considering cognitive constraints within learning models may help to understand how humans learn when making inferences.},

Undergraduate students (N = 82) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 training conditions (constant or variable) for a computer decision-making task. Measures of self-efficacy (intensity and generality) and transfer (near and far) were assessed. The results provided support for some of the hypothesized relationships. Specifically, practice variability led to increased self-efficacy generality.

Here I develop such a theory that is based on the assumption that GOALs guide Intentional Actions THrough criteria (GOALIATH). The theory is intended to be minimalist and parsimonious with respect to its assumptions, as transparent and mechanistic as possible, and it is based on representational assumptions provided by the Theory of Event Coding (TEC). It holds that goal-directed behavior is guided by selection criteria that activate and create competition between event files that contain action-effect codes matching one or more of the criteria{\textemdash}a competition that eventually settles into a solution favoring the best-matching event file. The criteria are associated with various sources, including biological drives, acquired needs (e.g., of achievement, power, or affiliation), and short-term, sometimes arbitrary, instructed aims. Action selection is, thus, a compromise that tries to satisfy various criteria related to different driving forces, which are also likely to vary in strength over time. Hence, what looks like goal-directed action emerges from, and represents an attempt to satisfy multiple constraints with different origins, purposes, operational characteristics, and timescales{\textemdash}which among other things does not guarantee a high degree of coherence or rationality of the eventual outcome. GOALIATH calls for a radical break with conventional theorizing about the control of goal-directed behavior, as it among other things questions existing cognitive-control theories and dual-route models of action control.},

  abstract = {Face recognition is a challenging classification task that humans perform effortlessly for familiar faces. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of exposure to high variability appearances of the same identity to perform this task. However, these studies did not explicitly measure the perceptual similarity between the learned images and the images presented at test, which may account for the advantage of learning from high variability. Particularly, randomly selected test images are more likely to be perceptually similar to learned high variability images, and dissimilar to learned low variability images. Here we dissociated effects of learning from variability and study-test perceptual similarity, by collecting human similarity ratings for the study and test images. Using these measures, we independently manipulated the variability between the learning images and their perceptual similarity to the test images. Different groups of participants learned face identities from a low or high variability set of images. The learning phase was followed by a face matching test (Experiment 1) or a face recognition task (Experiment 2) that presented novel images of the learned identities that were perceptually dissimilar or similar to the learned images. Results of both experiments show that perceptual similarity between study and test, rather than image variability at learning per se, predicts face recognition. We conclude that learning from high variability improves face recognition for perceptually similar but not for perceptually dissimilar images. These findings may not be specific to faces and should be similarly evaluated for other domains.},

With this distinction in mind, we revisit a previously studied categorization experiment that showed people are biased towards categorizing objects into a category with higher variability. Modelling results predict that generative learners should be more greatly affected by category variability than discriminative learners. We show that humans can be prompted to adopt either a generative or discriminative approach to learning the same input, resulting in the predicted effect on use of category variability.},

  abstract = {Background: Individual differences in reward-related processes, such as reward responsivity and approach motivation, appear to play a role in the nature and course of depression. Prior work suggests that cognitive biases for valenced information may contribute to these reward processes. Yet there is little work examining how biased attention, processing, and memory for positively- and negatively-valenced information may be associated with reward-related processes in samples with depression symptoms. Methods: We used a data-driven, machine-learning (elastic net) approach to identify the best predictors of self-reported reward-related processes using multiple tasks of attention, processing, and memory for valenced information measured across behavioral, eye tracking, psychophysiological, and computational modeling approaches (N = 202). Participants were adults (ages 18 - 35) who ranged in depression symptom severity from mild to severe. Results: Models predicted between 5.0-12.2\% and 9.7-28.0\% of held-out test sample variance in approach motivation and reward responsivity, respectively. Low self-referential processing of positively-valenced information was the most robust, albeit modest, predictor of low approach motivation and reward responsivity. Conclusions: Self-referential processing of positive information is the strongest predictor of reward responsivity and approach motivation in a sample ranging from mild to severe depression symptom severity. Experiments are now needed to clarify the causal relationship between self-referential processing of positively-valenced information and reward processes in depression.

According to Attention Theory (Kruschke, 1996, 2003), people preferentially attend to differentiating information in order to maximize category learning. When learning multiple social categories, people attend to all features that characterize the first-learned category but shift their attention to features that uniquely distinguish a later-learned category from the first. As a result, they form a stronger impression of the later-learned social category. First, we review research on attentional processes in stereotype formation and group categorization. We show how Attention Theory can account for both category accentuation and illusory correlation in the formation of majority and minority group stereotypes. We then explain how attention shifting influences face perception and racial categorization. Second, we describe attentional processes as they relate to context-based impression formation and the influence of individual- and group-based expectancies on context-based impressions. Last, we discuss implications for impression change.},

  abstract = {This thesis project investigates the process of theory formation through a study design we call Mystery Functions. Previous works have investigated how people collect and respond to data that they retrieve from a central ``oracle'' entity. Under this design paradigm, participants are given the means to query an all-knowing source of truth for data about some observed phenomenon with the goal of coming up with a theory that totally explains it. The oracle answers all queries immediately and perfectly, giving exactly the data asked for. To determine whether they have succeeded, participants present their theory to the oracle, and the oracle tells them whether or not it's correct. We designed an activity after this model in which participants guess what a computational function does. At first, the only pieces of information they know are the number of inputs and the input and output types of the function; then, they are given the means to ask for the corresponding output of any input and make a guess about the function. The activity is implemented as a web application. We conducted a study with 68 students from a psychology subject pool at Indiana University Bloomington, and 80 students from a software engineering class at Brown University. Our contributions are the dataset of inputs evaluated, quiz attempts made, and labeled guesses about the functions, and our analysis. Though the quality of guesses given by the two groups of students varies substantially, both groups exhibit similar patterns, such as doing most of their data collection before making their first guess. While collecting data, they made repetitive changes to past queries for data to generate future queries.},

One is an implicit recalibration process driven by sensory-prediction errors; the other process counters the perturbation through more deliberate compensation. Prior experience is known to enable adaptation to occur more rapidly, a phenomenon known as ``savings,'' but exactly how experience alters each underlying learning process remains unclear. We measured the relative contributions of implicit recalibration and deliberate compensation to savings across 2 days of practice adapting to a visuomotor rotation. The rate of implicit recalibration showed no improvement with repeated practice. Instead, practice led to deliberate compensation being expressed even when preparation time was very limited. This qualitative change is consistent with the proposal that practice establishes a cached association linking target locations to appropriate motor output, facilitating a transition from deliberate to automatic action selection. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Recent research has shown that savings for visuomotor adaptation is attributable to retrieval of intentional, strategic compensation. This does not seem consistent with the implicit nature of memory for motor skills and calls into question the validity of visuomotor adaptation of reaching movements as a model for motor skill learning. Our findings suggest a solution: that additional practice adapting to a visuomotor perturbation leads to the caching of the initially explicit strategy for countering it.},

Among the results was a dissociation in which participants classified transfer items with high accuracy in the no-repeat condition, yet in old-new recognition tests showed no ability to discriminate between old and new items of the same level of distortion from the prototype. In addition, speed of classification learning was no faster in a condition in which a small set of training instances was repeated continuously compared with the no-repeat condition. Here we show through computer-simulation modeling that exemplar models naturally capture the classification-recognition dissociation in the no-repeat condition, as well as a wide variety of other qualitative effects reported by Homa et al.

In contrast to Homa et al. (2019) we find that speed of learning is substantially faster in the repeat condition than in the no-repeat condition, precisely as exemplar models predict. The exemplar model also captures a wide variety of transfer effects observed following the completion of category learning, including the classification-recognition dissociation observed across the repeat and no-repeat conditions.

More recent work suggests, however, that when the number of training trials is equated across low-variability and high-variability training conditions, it is low-variability training that yields better generalization performance. Whereas the recent studies used cartoon-animal stimuli varying along binary-valued dimensions, in the present work we return to the use of prototype-distorted dot-pattern stimuli that had been used in the original classic studies. In accord with the recent findings, we observe that high-variability training does not enhance generalization in the dot-pattern prototype-distortion paradigm when the total number of training trials is equated across the conditions, even when training with very large numbers of distinct instances. A baseline version of an exemplar model captures the major qualitative pattern of results in the experiment, as do prototype models that make allowance for changes in parameter settings across the different training conditions. Based on the modeling results, we hypothesize that although high-variability training does not enhance generalization in the prototype-distortion paradigm, it may do so when participants learn more complex category structures.},

The so-called `exponential growth bias' is of new relevance in the context of COVID-19, because it explains why humans have fundamental difficulties to grasp the magnitude of a spreading epidemic. Here, we addressed the question, whether logarithmic scaling and contextual framing of epidemiological data affect the anticipation of exponential growth. Our findings show that underestimations were most pronounced when growth curves were linearly scaled and framed in the context of a more advanced epidemic progression. For logarithmic scaling, estimates were much more accurate, on target for growth rates around 31\%, and not affected by contextual framing. We conclude that the logarithmic depiction is conducive for detecting exponential growth during an early phase as well as resurgences of exponential growth.},

  abstract = {The Inverse Base Rate Effect (IBRE; Medin and Edelson (1988)) is a non-rational behavioural phenomenon in predictive learning. In the IBRE, participants learn that a stimulus compound AB leads to one outcome and that another compound AC leads to a different outcome. Importantly, AB and its outcome are presented three times as often as AC (and its outcome). On test, when asked which outcome to expect on presentation of the novel compound BC, participants preferentially select the rarer outcome, previously associated with AC. This is irrational because, objectively, the common outcome is more likely. Usually, the IBRE is attributed to greater attention paid to cue C than to cue B, and so is an excellent test for attentional learning models. The current experiment tested a simple model of attentional learning proposed by Le Pelley, Mitchell, Beesley, George, and Wills (2016) where attention paid to a stimulus is determined by its associative strength. This model struggles to capture the IBRE, but a potential solution suggested by the authors appeals to the role of experimental context. In the present paper, we derive three predictions from their account concerning the effect of changing to a novel experimental context at test, and examine these predictions empirically. Only one of the predictions was supported, concerning the effect of a context shift on responding to a novel cue, was supported. In contrast, Kruschke (2001b)'s EXIT model, in which attention and associative strength can vary independently, captured the data with a high degree of quantitative accuracy.},

  abstract = {Exemplar models are often used in research on multiple-cue judgments to describe the underlying process of participants' responses. In these experiments, participants are repeatedly presented with the same exemplars (e.g., poisonous bugs) and instructed to memorize these exemplars and their corresponding criterion values (e.g., the toxicity of a bug). We propose that there are two possible outcomes when participants judge one of the already learned exemplars in some later block of the experiment. They either have memorized the exemplar and their respective criterion value and are thus able to recall the exact value, or they have not learned the exemplar and thus have to judge its criterion value, as if it was a new stimulus. We argue that psychologically, the judgments of participants in a multiple-cue judgment experiment are a mixture of these two qualitatively distinct cognitive processes: judgment and recall. However, the cognitive modeling procedure usually applied does not make any distinction between these processes and the data generated by them. We investigated potential effects of disregarding the distinction between these two processes on the parameter recovery and the model fit of one exemplar model. We present results of a simulation as well as the reanalysis of five experimental data sets showing that the current combination of experimental design and modeling procedure can bias parameter estimates, impair their validity, and negatively affect the fit and predictive performance of the model. We also present a latent-mixture extension of the original model as a possible solution to these issues.},

In their original article, a least-squares (LS) optimization procedure was used to estimate the model parameters. Despite general evidence for the validity of the model, the authors suggested that a strong bias in favoring the rule module could arise when there is noise in the data. In this article, we present a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of the RulEx-J model with the goal to rectify this problem. In a series of simulation studies, we demonstrate the ability of the hierarchical Bayesian RulEx-J model to recover parameters accurately and to be more robust against noise in the data, compared to an LS estimation routine. One further advantage of the hierarchical Bayesian approach is the direct implementation of hypotheses about group differences in the model structure. A validation experiment as well as reanalyses of two experiments from different labs demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for testing hypotheses about processing differences. Further applications for judgment research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Subjects of all ages used sample size and variability to make their population estimates. Even the youngest children gave significantly lower population estimates for low-variability than for high-variability samples, and for smaller (one or three) than for larger (30) samples. Although the use of sample size depended on variability, this relationship did not change by age group. Variability and domain, however, each independently interacted with age group. Most of the differences in population estimates appeared to be due to sample variability rather than to sample size.},

  abstract = {People can easily evoke previously encountered concepts, compose them, and apply the result to novel contexts in a zero-shot manner. What computational mechanisms underpin this ability? To study this question, we propose an extension to the structured multi-armed bandit paradigm, which has been used to probe human function learning in previous works. This new paradigm involves a learning curriculum where agents first perform two sub-tasks in which rewards were sampled from differently structured reward functions, followed by a third sub-task in which rewards were set to a composition of the previously encountered reward functions. This setup allows us to investigate how people reason compositionally over learned functions, while still being simple enough to be tractable. Human behavior in such tasks has been predominantly modeled by computational models with hard-coded structures such as Bayesian grammars. We indeed find that such a model performs well on our task. However, they do not explain how people learn to compose reward functions via trial and error but have, instead, been hand-designed to generalize compositionally by expert researchers. How could the ability to compose ever emerge through trial and error? We propose a model based on the principle of meta-learning to tackle this challenge and find that {\textendash} upon training on the previously described curriculum {\textendash} meta-learned agents exhibit characteristics comparable to those of a Bayesian agent with compositional priors. Model simulations suggest that both models can compose earlier learned functions to generalize in a zero-shot manner. We complemented these model simulations results with a behavioral study, in which we investigated how human participants approach our task. We find that they are indeed able to perform zero-shot compositional reasoning as predicted by our models. Taken together, our study paves a way for studying compositional reinforcement learning in humans, symbolic, and sub-symbolic agents.},

Previous research has shown that people rarely apply this logic when faced with prioritizing dilemmas. The pairs of tasks in previous research had equal utility, which according to some models, can disrupt decision-making. We investigated whether the equivalence of two tasks contributes to suboptimal decisions about how to prioritize them. If so, removing or manipulating the arbitrary nature of the decision between options should facilitate optimal decisions about whether to focus effort on one goal or divide effort over two. Across all three experiments, however, participants did not appropriately adjust their decisions with task difficulty. The only condition in which participants adopted a strategy that approached optimal was when they had voluntarily placed more reward on one task over the other. For the task that was more rewarded, choices were modified more effectively with task difficulty. However, participants were more likely to choose to distribute rewards equally than unequally. The results demonstrate that situations involving choices between options with equal utility are not avoided and are even slightly preferred over unequal options, despite unequal options having larger potential gains and leading to more effective prioritizing strategies.},

According to instance theory, humans store individual experiences in episodic memory and general-level and semantic knowledge such as categories, word meanings and associations emerge during retrieval.

Despite their remarkable success at fitting human semantic data, virtually all DSMs may be classified as prototype models in that they try to construct a single representation for a word's meaning aggregated across contexts. This prototype representation conflates multiple meanings and senses of words into a center of tendency, often losing the subordinate senses of a word in favor of more frequent ones. We present an alternative instance-based DSM based on the classic MINERVA 2 multiple-trace model of episodic memory. The model stores a representation of each language instance in a corpus, and a word's meaning is constructed on-the-fly when presented with a retrieval cue. Across two experiments with homonyms in both an artificial and natural language corpus, we show how the instance-based model can naturally account for the subordinate meanings of words in appropriate context due to nonlinear activation over stored instances, but classic prototype DSMs cannot. The instance-based account suggests that meaning may not be something that is created during learning or stored per se, but may rather be an artifact of retrieval from an episodic memory store.},

More recently, hybrid theories of categorization have been proposed that variously combine these different forms of category representation. Our research addressed the question of whether there are representational shifts during category learning. We report a series of experiments that tracked how individual subjects generalized their acquired cate- gory knowledge to classifying new critical transfer items as a function of learning. In- dividual differences were observed in the generalization patterns exhibited by subjects, and those generalizations changed systematically with experience. Early in learning, subjects generalized on the basis of single diagnostic dimensions, consistent with the use of simple categorization rules. Later in learning, subjects generalized in a manner consistent with the use of similarity-based exemplar retrieval, attending to multiple stimulus dimensions. Theoretical modeling was used to formally corroborate these empirical observations by comparing fits of rule, prototype, and exemplar models to the observed categorization data. Although we provide strong evidence for shifts in the kind of information used to classify objects as a function of categorization ex- perience, interpreting these results in terms of shifts in representational systems under- lying perceptual categorization is a far thornier issue. We provide a discussion of the challenges of making claims about category representation, making reference to a wide body of literature suggesting different kinds of representational systems in per- ceptual categorization and related domains of human cognition.},

  abstract = {Contextual diversity (CD; Adelman, Brown, \& Quesada, 2006) modifies word frequency by ignoring word repetition in context. It has been repeatedly found that a CD count provides a better fit to lexical organization data than does word frequency (e.g., Adelman \& Brown, 2008; Brysbaert \& New, 2009). The importance of CD has been interpreted with the principle of likely need, adapted from the rational analysis of memory (Anderson \& Schooler, 1991), which states that words that have been used in many past contexts are more likely to be needed in a future context. Central to the cognitive mechanisms of computing likely need is a definition of linguistic context itself. Typically, linguistic context is defined by relatively small units of language, such as a document within a corpus. However, recent research has demonstrated that larger definitions of context, some spanning tens or hundreds of thousands of words, provide a better accounting of lexical organization data (Johns, Dye, \& Jones, 2020). This article attempts to redefine the notion of linguistic context by using socially based contextual measures, derived from the online communication patterns of hundreds of thousands of individuals from the discussion forum Reddit, consisting of over 55 billion words. Multiple count-based and semantic diversity models of contextual diversity were derived from this data. The results demonstrate that the communication patterns of individuals across discourses provides the best accounting of lexical organization data, indicating that classic notions of using local linguistic context to update a word's strength in the lexicon need to be reevaluated.

As a case study, we investigate laypeople's intuitions about curve-fitting in visually presented graphs, a domain with established quantitative criteria for trading off simplicity and goodness-of-fit. We examine whether people are well-calibrated to normative criteria, or whether they instead have an underfitting or overfitting bias (Experiment 1), we test people's intuitions in cases where simplicity and goodness-of-fit are no longer inversely correlated (Experiment 2), and we directly measure judgments concerning the complexity and goodness-of-fit in a set of curves (Experiment 3).

But are there more reasons to keep redundancy in neural networks? Can redundancy help neural networks perform different tasks and increase the efficiency of the network's performance? This paper investigates the role of redundancy in recurrent associative memory (RAM) by comparing redundant RAM networks to non-redundant RAM networks along the lines of learning, recall, and the ability to perform pattern segmentation. A bi-directional heteroassociative memory (BHM) recurrent neural network is used as the base network and modified to produce a network with redundancy. The amount of redundancy, memory load, noise in recall, and pattern segmentation ability are all set to varying levels to get the comprehensive picture of how redundancy affects the network. Ultimately, redundancy does have a purpose if there are weight differences for the input going into the redundant networks, i.e., there is redundancy in network structure, but these individual networks contain unique values for the input. The improvement is especially noticeable in the task of pattern segmentation. Having neural networks perform more complex tasks may provide even more incentive to incorporate redundancy into the network architecture.},

  abstract = {High phonological neighborhood density has been associated with both advantages and disadvantages in early word learning. High density may support the formation and fine-tuning of new word sound memories{\textemdash}a process termed lexical configuration (e.g., Storkel, 2004). However, new high-density words are also more likely to be misunderstood as instances of known words, and may therefore fail to trigger the learning process (e.g., Swingley \& Aslin, 2007). To examine these apparently contradictory effects, we trained an autoencoder neural network on 587,954 word tokens (5,497 types, including mono- and multisyllabic words of all grammatical classes) spoken by 279 caregivers to English-speaking children aged 18{\textendash}24 months. We then simulated a communicative development inventory administration and compared network performance to that of 2,292 children aged 18{\textendash}24 months. We argue that autoencoder performance illustrates concurrent density advantages and disadvantages, in contrast to prior behavioral and computational literature treating such effects independently. Low network error rates signal a configuration advantage for high-density words, while high network error rates signal a triggering advantage for low-density words. This interpretation is consistent with the application of autoencoders in academic research and industry, for simultaneous feature extraction (i.e., configuration) and anomaly detection (i.e., triggering). Autoencoder simulation therefore illustrates how apparently contradictory density and distinctiveness effects can emerge from a common learning mechanism.

However, the assumptions that underlie decompositions used in the analysis of human error differ substantially from those used in the analysis of models. The lens model, one of the most popular error decompositions for human errors, treats the beliefs of the human forecaster as fixed parameters to be estimated. Modern decompositions of model error treat the model as a random result from the process of fitting to noisy data. We highlight how these different approaches can be combined, expanding the application of the lens model to groups and opening up new perspectives on the study of human forecasting. We argue that treating human beliefs as the result of a process of learning from noisy data (even without specifying that process) can help to explain many documented phenomena in the world of forecasting such as: what kinds of environments human judgment will have difficulty with and what kinds they will be successful in; what conditions underlie the success of bootstrapping and aggregation of independent forecasts. Just as understanding statistical models as random variables has helped to improve the understanding of error in statistics and machines learning, we believe this framework will be able to help guide the literature on human judgment to a better understanding of error, its determinants and the mechanisms capable of improving forecasting accuracy.},

While computational models can offer deep explanations of cognition, they are computationally complex and often out of reach of traditional parameter fitting methods. Weak methodology may lead to premature rejection of valid models or to acceptance of models that might otherwise be falsified. Mathematically robust fitting methods are, therefore, essential to the progress of computational modeling in cognitive science. In this article, we investigate the capability and role of modern fitting methods{\textemdash}including Bayesian optimization and approximate Bayesian computation{\textemdash}and contrast them to some more commonly used methods: grid search and Nelder{\textendash}Mead optimization. Our investigation consists of a reanalysis of the fitting of two previous computational models: an Adaptive Control of Thought{\textemdash}Rational model of skill acquisition and a computational rationality model of visual search. The results contrast the efficiency and informativeness of the methods. A key advantage of the Bayesian methods is the ability to estimate the uncertainty of fitted parameter values. We conclude that approximate Bayesian computation is (a) efficient, (b) informative, and (c) offers a path to reproducible results.},

Previous research has suggested that the presence of background noise extends the number of candidate words competing with the target word for recognition and that this extension affects the time course and accuracy of spoken-word recognition. In this study, we further investigated the temporal dynamics of competition processes in the presence of background noise, and how these vary in listeners with different language proficiency (i.e., native and non-native) using computational modeling. We developed ListenIN (Listen-In-Noise), a neural-network model based on an autoencoder architecture, which learns to map phonological forms onto meanings in two languages and simulates native and non-native spoken-word comprehension. We also examined the model's activation states during online spoken-word recognition. These analyses demonstrated that the presence of background noise increases the number of competitor words, which are engaged in phonological competition and that this happens in similar ways intra and interlinguistically and in native and non-native listening. Taken together, our results support accounts positing a ``many-additional-competitors scenario'' for the effects of noise on spoken-word recognition.},

Brunswik's (1952) lens model has been used extensively to study human judgment and provides a unique opportunity to conduct a meta-analysis of studies that covers roughly 5 decades. Specifically, the authors analyzed statistics of the "lens model equation" (L. R. Tucker, 1964) associated with 249 different task environments obtained from 86 articles. On average, fairly high levels of judgmental achievement were found, and people were seen to be capable of achieving similar levels of cognitive performance in noisy and predictable environments. Further, the effects of task characteristics that influence judgment (numbers and types of cues, inter-cue redundancy, function forms and cue weights in the ecology, laboratory versus field studies, and experience with the task) were identified and estimated. A detailed analysis of learning studies revealed that the most effective form of feedback was information about the task. The authors also analyzed empirically under what conditions the application of bootstrapping--or replacing judges by their linear models--is advantageous. Finally, the authors note shortcomings of the kinds of studies conducted to date, limitations in the lens model methodology, and possibilities for future research.},

Although there is some evidence in favor of an associationist position, a large body of evidence has been supportive of Lashley's seminal ideas. Moreover, a variety of paradigms including reaction time, pauses between successive motor acts, and transfer of learning have emphasized two concepts that characterize these plans or motor programs. First, the plans that guide activity are hierarchical in nature. Second, many sequence representations can be regarded as modular in that they are separable from the muscular system of initial learning and can be interfaced with various other modules to produce novel actions. Hierarchic and modular components are thus viewed as important components for any model of sequencing. One particular computational model developed by Jordan is described and analyzed in terms of how well it meets this criterion.},

We contrast three variants of rule-based and associative `neural network' models with two variants of a Bayesian regression forecasting model. The tasks involve: deterministic and stochastic functions, functions with equal and unequal stimuli weights, functions with large and small numbers of stimuli, and linear and nonlinear functions. Evidence of task specificity would be implied if the most descriptive model of learning does systematically vary by task and subject; the alternative independence hypothesis is implied if there are no performance differences. We find two primary results: first, there is evidence of the task independence of learning; and the most valid model is a neural network variant. However, if the criterion variance is large or there are a large number of cues relevant for making predictions, the results favor Bayesian forecasting methods for providing reliable and valid predictions of human responses.},

We conducted a series of experiments to address this issue by examining how performance on a task changed after repeated exposure to distractors. Distraction initially slowed response time during task performance, an effect that diminished with repeated exposure to the distractors. When the distractors were consistent in appearance, the practice effect developed quickly but was stimulus-specific. When the distractors were more variable in appearance, the practice effect developed slowly but transferred more readily to other conditions. These data indicate that practice with overcoming distraction leads to improvements in information filtering mechanisms that generalize beyond the training regimen when variable distractor stimuli are experienced.},

For the throwing test the children were assigned to either a specificity or a schema group (varied practice). The task was performed without visual feedback, but knowledge of results was given after each trial. Prior to both tests at the criterion target, the specific group was given practice throws using the criterion target distance, whereas the schema group practiced on two other targets. No differences were found between the two groups at the beginning of the program but on the posttest those children receiving a variety of practice on the throwing task performed significantly better than the specific-practice group. Thus it was suggested that a varied practice schedule may facilitate the initial formation of motor schema, and this process may be enhanced by participation in a physical education program.},

  abstract = {The goal of this article is to investigate how human participants allocate their limited time to decisions with different properties. We report the results of two behavioral experiments. In each trial of the experiments, the participant must accumulate noisy information to make a decision. The participants received positive and negative rewards for their correct and incorrect decisions, respectively. The stimulus was designed such that decisions based on more accumulated information were more accurate but took longer. Therefore, the total outcome that a participant could achieve during the limited experiments' time depended on her ``decision threshold'', the amount of information she needed to make a decision. In the first experiment, two types of trials were intermixed randomly: hard and easy. Crucially, the hard trials were associated with smaller positive and negative rewards than the easy trials. A cue presented at the beginning of each trial would indicate the type of the upcoming trial. The optimal strategy was to adopt a small decision threshold for hard trials. The results showed that several of the participants did not learn this simple strategy. We then investigated how the participants adjusted their decision threshold based on the feedback they received in each trial. To this end, we developed and compared 10 computational models for adjusting the decision threshold. The models differ in their assumptions on the shape of the decision thresholds and the way the feedback is used to adjust the decision thresholds. The results of Bayesian model comparison showed that a model with time-varying thresholds whose parameters are updated by a reinforcement learning algorithm is the most likely model. In the second experiment, the cues were not presented. We showed that the optimal strategy is to use a single time-decreasing decision threshold for all trials. The results of the computational modeling showed that the participants did not use this optimal strategy. Instead, they attempted to detect the difficulty of the trial first and then set their decision threshold accordingly.},

  abstract = {Successful speech perception requires that listeners map the acoustic signal to linguistic categories. These mappings are not only probabilistic, but change depending on the situation. For example, one talker's /p/ might be physically indistinguishable from another talker's /b/ (cf. lack of invariance). We characterize the computational problem posed by such a subjectively non-stationary world and propose that the speech perception system overcomes this challenge by (1) recognizing previously encountered situations, (2) generalizing to other situations based on previous similar experience, and (3) adapting to novel situations. We formalize this proposal in the ideal adapter framework: (1) to (3) can be understood as inference under uncertainty about the appropriate generative model for the current talker, thereby facilitating robust speech perception despite the lack of invariance. We focus on two critical aspects of the ideal adapter. First, in situations that clearly deviate from previous experience, listeners need to adapt. We develop a distributional (belief-updating) learning model of incremental adaptation. The model provides a good fit against known and novel phonetic adaptation data, including perceptual recalibration and selective adaptation. Second, robust speech recognition requires listeners learn to represent the structured component of cross-situation variability in the speech signal. We discuss how these two aspects of the ideal adapter provide a unifying explanation for adaptation, talker-specificity, and generalization across talkers and groups of talkers (e.g., accents and dialects). The ideal adapter provides a guiding framework for future investigations into speech perception and adaptation, and more broadly language comprehension.},

In contrast, systematic response biases occurred during the early phases of learning the logarithmic and linear functions. As practice progressed, however, the biases gradually disappeared. These results support an adaptive regression model. According to it, people learn functions through a subjective process analogous to statistical regression.

  abstract = {Humans need to reason about the unknown constantly utilising similar existing knowledge as well as explore the unknown to gather more information for the future. I investigate this kind of human exploration and extrapolation in simple conceptual and spatial tasks in this thesis using Bayesian optimisation. My work extends Wu et al. paper Similarities and differences in spatial and nonspatial cognitive maps [Wu et al., 2020] where they model human exploration and extrapolation with Bayesian optimisation using an acquisition function and an activation function to represent human exploration and a Gaussian process to model the participant's belief of the environment based on the knowledge they acquire. Wu et al. use Bayesian optimisation to model human behaviour in these tasks as their main model of choice. Their model consists of a Gaussian process with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function and softmax activation function to transform the output of the acquisition function. Their model has three free parameters: the length scale of the RBF kernel {$\lambda$} describing the extent of generalisation, the exploration bonus of UCB sampling {$\beta$} and the temperature of softmax activation function {$\tau$} [Wu et al., 2020]. I attempt to extend their work by allowing the length scale parameter {$\lambda$} of the RBF kernel to change when participants explore the presented space and gather more information. This will model how the participants learn the extent of generalisation as they explore the space and gain more knowledge of the underlying environment. This model with a changing length scale parameter managed to improve the goodness of fit when compared to the model used by Wu et al. [Wu et al., 2020], but it failed to capture all of the behavioural differences between spatial and conceptual tasks. It is possible that the values estimated for the length scale parameter {$\lambda$} could have also absorbed information that would have otherwise allowed the other parameters {$\tau$} and {$\beta$} to capture the differences between the spatial and conceptual tasks. This thesis provides a basis for further research of human exploration and extrapolation utilising Bayesian optimisation with a changing degree of generalisation where the aforementioned shortcomings could be mitigated for example by designing the experiment in a way that provides more information about the participant's belief of the environment during each trial.

Two experiments used a computerized rectangle drawing task that required participants to click and drag a mouse cursor to create rectangles on a computer screen. In Experiment 1, one group received points when successive rectangles varied in their size, shape and location (VAR), another group were yoked to the VAR group and received points that were allocated to them using a yoking procedure (YOKE), regardless of the variability in the size, shape or location of the rectangle drawn. Variability was higher for a dimension when variability on that dimension was directly reinforced. In Experiment 2, three groups of participants received points when rectangles varied on two dimensions; each group differed in the two dimensions that required variation. Variability was again higher for the reinforced dimensions for two of the three groups. Comparison with the YOKE group showed that the variability on those dimensions where variability was not directly reinforced was affected by reinforcement for variability on the other dimensions. Specifically, the variability in Shape and Location was significantly higher when these two dimensions occurred with other dimensions where variability was reinforced (as in Experiment 2) compared to when they were not required to vary (as in the YOKE group). This suggests that, for these two groups, the reinforced variability on the other two dimensions generalized to the third dimension. Implications of this finding to our understanding of factors that promote behavioral variability are discussed.},

We note that people frequently obtain larger samples of information about in-groups than about out-groups. Using computer simulations, we show that this asymmetry in sample sizes implies the in-group heterogeneity effect under a wide range of assumptions about how experience affects perceived variability. This is the case even when perceived variability is the outcome of rational information processing, implying that the structure of the environment is sufficient to explain the emergence of the in-group heterogeneity effect. A key assumption of our explanation is that perceived group variability depends on the size of the sample observed about this group. We provide evidence in support for this assumption in two experiments. Our results considerably expand the scope and relevance of a prior sampling explanation proposed by Linville, Fischer, and Salovey (1989). They also complement other explanations that proposed that information about in-groups and out-groups is processed differently. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

To what extent do statistical concepts also play a role for people assessing the environment? Previous work on the mind as ``intuitive statistician'' has mainly focused on the judgment of means and correlations (Peterson \& Beach, 1967). Much less is known about how people conceptualize and judge variance. In a survey and three experimental studies, we explored people's intuitive understanding of variance as a concept and investigated the factors affecting people's judgments of variance. The survey findings showed that most people hold concepts of variance that they can articulate; these concepts, however, reflect not only statistical variance (i.e., deviations from the average) but also the pairwise distance between stimuli, their range, and their variety. The experimental studies revealed that although people's judgments of variance are sensitive to the statistical variance of stimuli, variety and range also play an important role. The results can inform psychological models of judgments of variance.},

SoA arises from implicit processing of sensorimotor signals as well as explicit higher-level judgments. Psychosis patients suffer from difficulties in the sense of control over their actions and accurate demarcation of the Self. Moreover, it is unclear if they have metacognitive insight into their aberrant abilities. In this pre-registered study, we examined SoA and its associated confidence judgments using an embodied virtual reality paradigm in psychosis patients and controls. Our results show that psychosis patients not only have a severely reduced ability for discriminating their actions but they also do not show proper metacognitive insight into this deficit. Furthermore, an exploratory analysis revealed that the SoA capacities allow for high levels of accuracy in clinical classification of psychosis. These results indicate that SoA and its metacognition are core aspects of the psychotic state and provide possible venues for understanding the underlying mechanisms of psychosis, that may be leveraged for novel clinical purposes.},

  abstract = {ALCOVE is a new connectionist model of category learning that models the course of learning in humans and their asymptotic performance. The model is a variant of back propagation, using Gaussian (radial basis function) hidden nodes, and adaptive attential strengths on the input dimensions. Unlike standard back propagation networks, ALCOVE cannot develop completely new dimensions for representing the stimuli, but it does learn to differentially attend to the given input dimensions. ALCOVE is succesfully applied to several category learning phenomena: (1) It correctly orders the difficulty of the six category types from the classic work of Shepard, Hovland and Jenkins (1961). (2) It accurately fits trial-by-trial learning data and mimics the base-rate neglect observed by Gluck and Bower (1988b). In preliminary work, it is also shown that ALCOVE can: (3) exhibit three-stage learning of high-frequency exceptions to rules (cf. Rumelhart \& McClelland 1986), (4) show emergent graded internal structure in categories, i.e., typicality ratings, (5) produce asymmetries of similarities between typical and atypical exemplars, (6) show selective sensitivity to correlated dimensions, and (7) learn non-linearly separable categories faster than linearly separable categories, in those cases that humans do. It is also suggested that ALCOVE could serve as the input to a rule generating system, so that the dimensions most attended are the ones first used for rules. Moreover, it is shown that ALCOVE is falsifiable, in principle, and that there are some phenomena in category learning that ALCOVE cannot capture. Nevertheless, ALCOVE is attractive because of the broad range of phenomena it does model.},

Results showed that reversal shift was easiest, follow ed, in order, by shift to a single previously relevant dimension, shift to a single previously irrelevant dimension, and a shift to a new XOR. An extended version of the ALCOVE model, called AM BRY, qualitatively {\textregistered} ts the data. The model incorporates two essential principles. First, internal category representations that can be quickly remapped to overt responses are important for accounting for the ease of reversal shift. Second, perseverating dimensional attention is important for accounting for the ease of shifting to a previously relevant dimension as opposed to a previously irrelevant dimension. It is suggested that any model of these effects will need to implement both of these principles.},

This article demonstrates that a standard version of backprop fails to attend selectively to input dimensions in the same way as humans, suffers catastrophic forgetting of previously learned associations when novel exemplars are trained, and can be overly sensitive to linear category boundaries. Another connectionist model, ALCOVE (Kruschke 1990, 1992), does not suffer those failures. Previous researchers identified these problems; the present article reports quantitative fits of the models to new human learning data. ALCOVE can be functionally approximated by a network that uses linear-sigmoid hidden nodes, like standard backprop. It is argued that models of human category learning should incorporate quasi-local representations and dimensional attention learning, as well as error-driven learning, to address simultaneously all three phenomena.},

Each layer then does locally Bayesian learning. The resulting parameter updating is not globally Bayesian, but can better capture human behavior. The approach is implemented for an associative learning model that first maps inputs to attentionally filtered inputs, and then maps attentionally filtered inputs to outputs. The model is applied to the humanlearning phenomenon called highlighting, which is challenging to other extant Bayesian models, including the rational model of Anderson, the Kalman filter model of Dayan and Kakade et al., the noisy-OR model of Tenenbaum and Griffiths et al., and the sigmoid-belief networks of Courville et al.

  abstract = {Many theories of learning provide no role for learned selective attention (e.g., Anderson, 1991; Pearce, 1994; Rehder \& Murphy, 2003). Selective attention is crucial, however, for explaining many phenomena in learning. The mechanism of selective attention in learning is also well motivated by its ability to minimize proactive interference and enhance generalization, thereby accelerating learning. Therefore, not only does the mechanism help explain behavioural phenomena, it makes sense that it should have evolved (Kruschke \& Hullinger, 2010). The phrase 'learned selective attention' denotes three qualities. First, 'attention' means the amplification or attenuation of the processing of stimuli. Second, 'selective' refers to differentially amplifying and/or attenuating a subset of the components of the stimulus. This selectivity within a stimulus is different from attenuating or amplifying all aspects of a stimulus simultaneously (cf. Larrauri \& Schmajuk, 2008). Third, 'learned' denotes the idea that the allocation of selective processing is retained for future use. The allocation may be context sensitive, so that attention is allocated differently in different contexts. There are many phenomena in human and animal learning that suggest the involvement of learned selective attention. The first part of this chapter briefly reviews some of those phenomena. The emphasis of the chapter is not the empirical phenomena, however. Instead, the focus is on a collection of models that formally express theories of learned attention. These models will be surveyed subsequently.},

The models unify formulas for associative weight change with formulas for attentional change, under a common goal of error reduction.

The models are fit to data from a recent experiment in human associative learning (J. K. Kruschke 6 N. J. Blair, 2000, Psychonomic Bulletin 6 Review, 7, 636 645), which shows that blocking of learning involves learned inattention.

We have designed an experiment in which 44 humans and three different machine learning algorithms identify patterns in labeled training data and have to label instances according to the patterns they find. The results show a high dependency between performance and the underlying patterns of the task. Whereas humans perform relatively similarly across all patterns, machines show large performance differences for the various patterns in our experiment. After seeing 20 instances in the experiment, human performance does not improve anymore, which we relate to theories of cognitive overload. Machines learn slower but can reach the same level or may even outperform humans in 2 of the 4 of used patterns. However, machines need more instances compared to humans for the same results. The performance of machines is comparably lower for the other 2 patterns due to the difficulty of combining input features.},

However, much like other behavioral measures, many IATs appear to show low test-retest reliability and typical scoring methods fail to quantify all of the decision-making processes that generate the overt task performance. Here, we develop a new modeling approach for IATs based on the geometric similarity representation (GSR) model. This model leverages both response times and accuracy on IATs to make inferences about representational similarity between the stimuli and categories. The model disentangles processes related to response caution, stimulus encoding, similarities between concepts and categories, and response processes unrelated to the choice itself. This approach to analyzing IAT data illustrates that the unreliability in IATs is almost entirely attributable to the methods used to analyze data from the task: GSR model parameters show test-retest reliability around .80-.90, on par with reliable self-report measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate how model parameters result in greater validity compared to the IAT D-score and traditional diffusion model contrasts, predicting outcomes related to intergroup contact and motivation. Finally, we present a simple point-and-click software tool for fitting the model, which uses a pre-trained neural network to estimate best-fit parameters of the GSR model. This approach allows easy and instantaneous fitting of IAT data with minimal demands on coding or technical expertise on the part of the user, making the new model accessible and effective.},

Even though nearly all of these models seek to extend diffusion decision processes to a continuum of response options, they vary in terms of complexity, tractability, and their ability to predict patterns of data such as multimodal distributions of responses. We suggest that these differences are almost entirely due to differences in how these models account for the similarity among response options. In this theoretical note, we reconcile these differences by characterizing the existing models under a common framework, where the assumptions about psychological representations of similarity, and their implications for behavioral data (e.g., multimodal responses), are made explicit. Furthermore, we imple- ment a simulation-based approach to computing model likelihoods that allows for greater freedom in constructing and implementing continuous response models. The resulting geometric similarity represen- tation (GSR) can supplement approaches like the circular/spherical diffusion models by allowing them to generate multimodal distributions of responses from a single drift, or simplify models like the spatially continuous diffusion model (SCDM) by condensing their representations of similarity and allowing them to generate simulations more efficiently. To illustrate its utility, we apply this approach to multimodal distributions responses, two-dimensional responses (such as locations on a computer screen), and continuous response options with nontrivial, nonlinear similarity relations between response options.},

  abstract = {Understanding the cognitive processes underlying choice requires theories that can disentangle the representation of stimuli from the processes that map these representations onto observed responses. We develop a dynamic theory of how stimuli are mapped onto discrete (choice) and onto continuous response scales. It proposes that the mapping from a stimulus to an internal representation and then to an evidence accumulation process is accomplished using multiple reference points or 'anchors.' Evidence is accumulated until a threshold amount for a particular response is obtained, with the relative balance of support for each anchor at that time determining the response. We tested this multiple anchored accumulation theory (MAAT) using the results of two experiments requiring discrete or continuous responses to line length and color stimuli. We manipulated the number of options for discrete responses, the number of different stimuli, and the similarity among them, and compared the outcomes to continuous response conditions. We show that MAAT accounts for several key phenomena: more accurate, faster, and more skewed distributions of responses near the ends of a response scale; lower accuracy and slower responses as the number of discrete choice options increases; and longer response times and lower accuracy when alternative responses are more similar to the target response. Our empirical and modeling results suggest that discrete and continuous response tasks can share a common evidence representation, and that the decision process is sensitive to the perceived similarity among the response options.

  abstract = {A function describes a one-to-one relationship between combinations of predictor and criterion variables. In this paper, we describe a new memory model that learns functional relationships. Two versions of the model are described. The first version learns the bivarite relationship between a single predictor and criterion. The second version expands on the first to multiple predictors. For both versions of the model, we present empirical data to test them and find that they do a good job of accounting for human performance.  Executive summary A function is a one-to-one relationship between a combination of predictor variables and criterion variables. There are few computational models that try to explain how people learn such relationships. There are generally two classes of model that could be used to explain the skill. Rule-abstraction models propose that trainees learn a representation of the training equation (akin to a regression equation) that maps the predictors onto the criterion. During learning, the system's job is to figure out the regression weights that do the best job. The other class of model, so-called exemplar models, propose that trainees make contact with and report the closest examples stored in memory from training. Both classes of model are wrong: Strict exemplar models cannot extrapolate to values it has not been trained on. Strict rule-abstraction models also fail because trainee's performance on extrapolation items tends to diverge from the values predicted by the training function. In this paper, we introduce an exemplar model that learns bivariate and multivariate functional relationships and has the ability to extrapolate to novel predictor values. The model is able to extrapolate because it learns the relative changes in the predictors and criterion as they occur from trial to trial, and uses that information to find the best value for extrapolation items. The model's performance is compared to human performance, and for both the bivariate and multivariate versions of the model, we show that it does a good job of accounting for trainees' performance. The model described in this report provides a simple, yet flexible, framework in which to characterize situations where an operator must learn a quantitative relationship between one or more predictors and a criterion variable. We are currently aiming to include the model in a virtual helicopter pilot to characterize knowledge of the relationship between the amount of movement in the controls (pedals, cyclic, collective) required in response to perturbations in the aircraft's position. Our intent is to build operator models for the CF that exhibit humanlike behaviours by virtue of the fact that they include psychological models of processes and knowledge representation. The model described in this report provides a basic architecture for representing knowledge of functional relationships in a virtual operator.},

Of particular interest in this article is the question of what information does a participant use to generate a response for test examples that fall outside the training region{\textemdash}so-called, extrapolation items. In this article, we test whether the presentation of training items has an impact on the pattern of responses for items requiring participants to extrapolate, and examine, whether the 2 dominant accounts of function learning (Population of Linear Experts [POLE]: Kalish, Lewandowsky, \& Kruschke, 2004; and Extrapolation Association Model [EXAM]: DeLosh, Busemeyer, \& McDaniel, 1997) can account for this effect. The results show that a manipulation of trial-to-trial changes in the relative magnitudes of the predictor and criterion does influence subsequent extrapolation, and neither POLE, nor EXAM, was able to account for this effect in their current forms. We demonstrate that a model that encodes information about the trial-to-trial changes in the predictor and criterion, and which subsequently uses this information to adjust the retrieved value of the criterion, can account for the effect.},

McDaniel (1997) found that when learning a positive, linear relationship between a continuous predictor (x) and a continuous criterion (y), trainees tend to underestimate y on items that ask the trainee to extrapolate. In 3 experiments, the authors examined the phenomenon and found that the tendency to underestimate y is reliable only in the so-called lower extrapolation region--that is, new values of x that lie between zero and the edge of the training region. Existing models of function learning, such as the extrapolation-association model (DeLosh et al., 1997) and the population of linear experts model (M. L. Kalish, S. Lewandowsky, \& J.

Data from 10 studies that investigated associations between practice structures and neurobiological substrates were analyzed. The participation of the indicated areas was found to depend on practice structure and varied during the learning process. Greater cognitive engagement was associated with random practice. In conclusion, distinct neural processes are engendered by different practice conditions.

This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

The latitude of acceptance hypothesis suggests that a wider range of individual group members are likely to be seen as good-fitting members (i.e., typical) if the group is heterogeneous, thereby increasing the extent to which stereotypical attitudes are used as a basis for responding to these persons. In contrast, the typicality-functionality hypothesis suggests that typicality plays different roles depending on group variability. This view suggests that typicality plays the ``gatekeeper function'' as postulated by Fiske and Neuberg (1990) when the group is homogeneous, but not when it is heterogeneous. Across two studies, stronger support was found for the typicality-functionality hypothesis. Implications for the extant literature on category-based processing are discussed.},

Humans can exhibit this cognitive flexibility. By contrast, models that achieve superhuman performance in specific tasks often fail to adapt to even slight task alterations. To address this, we propose a general computational framework for adapting to novel tasks based on their relationship to prior tasks. We begin by learning vector representations of tasks. To adapt to new tasks, we propose metamappings, higher-order tasks that transform basic task representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework across a wide variety of tasks and computational paradigms, ranging from regression to image classification and reinforcement learning. We compare to both human adaptability and language-based approaches to zero-shot learning. Across these domains, metamapping is successful, often achieving 80 to 90\% performance, without any data, on a novel task, even when the new task directly contradicts prior experience. We further show that metamapping can not only generalize to new tasks via learned relationships, but can also generalize using novel relationships unseen during training. Finally, using metamapping as a starting point can dramatically accelerate later learning on a new task and reduce learning time and cumulative error substantially. Our results provide insight into a possible computational basis of intelligent adaptability and offer a possible framework for modeling cognitive flexibility and building more flexible artificial intelligence systems.},

  abstract = {In the development of memory-based models of automaticity, it is crucial to specify the nature of the memory representation. Seven experiments with 94 students use a counting task to determine whether a feature (i.e., identity, color, or orientation) is explicitly represented in memory. It is assumed that the degree of transfer to a pattern differing on one feature is determined by that feature's importance in supporting skilled performance. Experiment 1 determined the practice necessary to obtain automaticity. In Experiments 2a, 3a, and 4a, which investigated the nature of the representation after extended practice, changing neither the identity nor color of elements had strong effects on transfer, but changing pattern orientation did impair memory retrieval, thus suggesting that for the counting task, pattern orientation is more important than element identity or color. Experiments 2b, 3b, and 4b replicated these results after limited practice. Memory-based models explain automaticity as a qualitative change in performance from algorithmic computation to memory retrieval. Logan's (1988a, 1988b, 1990, 1992) instance theory is a special case of memory-based models that characterizes processing as a race between the algorithm and},

In Experiment 1a, we contrasted high variability training sets {\textendash} which included stimuli extracted from a number of different recording sessions, speaking environments and speaking styles {\textendash} with low variability stimulus sets that only included a single speaking style (read speech) extracted from one recording session (see Ritchie \& Burton, 2017 for faces). Listeners were tested on an old/new recognition task using read sentences (i.e. test materials fully overlapped with the low variability training stimuli) and we found a high variability disadvantage. In Experiment 1b, listeners were trained in a similar way, however, now there was no overlap in speaking style or recording session between training sets and test stimuli. Here, we found a high variability advantage. In Experiment 2, variability was manipulated in terms of the number of unique items as opposed to number of unique speaking styles. Here, we contrasted the high variability training sets used in Experiment 1a with low variability training sets that included the same breadth of styles, but fewer unique items; instead, individual items were repeated (see Murphy, Ipser, Gaigg, \& Cook, 2015 for faces). We found only weak evidence for a high variability advantage, which could be explained by stimulus-specific effects. We propose that high variability advantages may be particularly pronounced when listeners are required to generalise from trained stimuli to different-sounding, previously unheard stimuli. We discuss these findings in the context of mechanisms thought to underpin advantages for high variability training.},

  abstract = {It is well established that random practice compared to blocked practice enhances motor learning. Additionally, while information in the environment may be incidental, learning is also enhanced when an individual performs a task within the same environmental context in which the task was originally practiced. This study aimed to disentangle the effects of practice schedule and incidental/environmental context on motor learning. Participants practiced three finger sequences under either a random or blocked practice schedule. Each sequence was associated with specific incidental context (i.e., color and location on the computer screen) during practice. The participants were tested under the conditions when the sequence-context associations remained the same or were changed from that of practice. When the sequencecontext association was changed, the participants who practiced under blocked schedule demonstrated greater performance decrement than those who practiced under random schedule. The findings suggested that those participants who practiced under random schedule were more resistant to the change of environmental context.},

  abstract = {In property induction tasks, encountering a diverse range of instances (e.g., hippos and hamsters) with a given property usually increases our willingness to generalise that property to a novel instance, relative to non-diverse evidence (e.g., hippos and rhinos). Although generalisation in property induction and predictive learning tasks share conceptual similarities, it is unknown whether this diversity principle applies to generalisation of a predictive association. We tested this hypothesis in two predictive learning experiments using differential training where one category of stimuli (e.g., fruits) predicted an outcome and another category (e.g., vegetables) predicted no outcome. We compared generalisation between a Non-Diverse group who were presented with non-diverse evidence in both positive (predicted the outcome) and negative (predicted no outcome) categories, and two groups who received the same training as the Non-Diverse group but with a more diverse range of exemplars in the positive (Diverse+ group) or negative (Diverse{\textendash} group) category. Diversity effects were found for both positive and negative categories, in that learning about a diverse range of exemplars increased generalisation of a predictive association to novel exemplars from that same category. The results suggest that diversity, a key principle describing how we reason inductively, also applies to generalisation in associative learning tasks.},

People are told how many numbers are in the list, and how they were chosen. People are then shown the numbers one at a time, and are instructed to choose the maximum, subject to the constraint that they must choose a number at the time it is presented, and any choice below the maximum is incorrect. We present empirical evidence that suggests people use threshold-based models to make decisions, choosing the first currently maximal number that exceeds a fixed threshold for that position in the list. We then develop a hierarchical generative account of this model family, and use Bayesian methods to learn about the parameters of the generative process, making inferences about the threshold decision models people use. We discuss the interesting aspects of human performance on the task, including the lack of learning, and the presence of large individual differences, and consider the possibility of extending the modeling framework to account for individual differences. We also use the modeling results to discuss the merits of hierarchical, generative and Bayesian models of cognitive processes more generally.},

Of these, only research using children as subjects has provided consistent results. Findings from adult studies have been equivocal. Two experiments were conducted to assess the possibility that the schedule of variable practice during acquisition may be a clue to this equivocality, since only experiments (using adults as subjects) that have provided random variability of practice conditions have consistently supported the tenets of schema theory. Using a two movement rapid timing task, subjects learned to control their actions under one (constant) or four (variable) parameters, with variable practice conducted under either a blocked or a randomized schedule. Results for variable error and absolute constant error showed that random-variable practice provided strong support for the schema theory prediction, whereas blocked-variable practice provided only relatively weak support. Two contrasting implications of these results are discussed with respect to support versus non-support for Schmidt's schema theory.},

Recent developments in the field have enabled testing the hierarchical similarity of object representation between the human brain and DNNs. However, the representational geometry of object exemplars within a single category using DNNs is unclear. In this study, we investigate which DNN model has the greatest ability to explain invariant within-category object representations by computing the similarity between representational geometries of visual features extracted at the high-level layers of different DNN models. We also test for the invariability of within-category object representations of these models by identifying object exemplars. Our results show that transfer learning models based on ResNet50 best explained both within-category object representation and object identification. These results suggest that the invariability of object representations in deep learning depends not on deepening the neural network but on building a better transfer learning model.},

  abstract = {Generalization is at the core of human intelligence. When the relationship between continuous-valued data is generalized, generalization amounts to function learning. Function learning is important for understanding human cognition, as many everyday tasks and problems involve learning how quantities relate and subsequently using this knowledge to predict novel relationships. While function learning has been studied in psychology since the early 1960s, this thesis argues that questions regarding representational characteristics have not been adequately addressed in previous research. Previous accounts of function learning have often proposed one-size-fits-all models that excel at capturing how participants learn and extrapolate. In these models, learning amounts to learning the details of the presented patterns. Instead, this thesis presents computational and empirical results arguing that participants often learn abstract features of the data, such as the type of function or the variability of features of the function, instead of the details of the function. While previous work has emphasized domain-general inductive biases and learning rates, I propose that these biases are more flexible and adaptive than previously suggested. Given contextual information that sequential tasks share the same structure, participants can transfer knowledge from previous training to inform their generalizations. Furthermore, this thesis argues that function representations can be composed to form more complex hypotheses, and humans are perceptive to, and sometimes generalize according to these compositional features. Previous accounts of function learning had to postulate a fixed set of candidate functions that form a participants' hypothesis space, which ultimately struggled to account for the variety of extrapolations people can produce. In contrast, this thesis's results suggest that a small set of broadly applicable functions, in combination with compositional principles, can produce flexible and productive generalization.

  abstract = {While the ability to acquire non-linearly separable (NLS) classifications is well documented in the study of human category learning, the relative ease of learning compared to a linear separable structure is difficult to evaluate without potential confounds. Medin and Schwanenflugel (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 7, 355-368, 1981) were the first to demonstrate that NLS classifications are not more difficult to acquire than linearly separable ones when structures are equated in terms of within- and between-category similarities. However, their evidence is less sturdy than might be expected due to non-standard methodology and low sample size. We conducted a conceptual replication to clarify the behavioral picture and perform qualitative testing of formal models. The behavioral results not only showed a lack of advantage for the linearly separable (LS) structure, but revealed a stronger finding: the NLS structure was reliably easier to acquire. Differences in the relative ease of NLS learners to master certain items yielded evidence for the existence of distinct learner subgroups, one marked by significantly easier (not harder) learning of exception items. Comparing the qualitative fits of leading computational models to the human learning performance confirmed that a pure prototype account, even with contemporary updates, remains incompatible with the data. However, exemplar models and similarity-based models grounded in sophisticated forms of abstraction-based learning successfully account for the NLS advantage. In sum, evidence against a linear separability constraint is redoubled, and the observed NLS advantage along with behavioral patterns seen at the subgroup and item level provide a valuable basis for comprehensive evaluation of competing theoretical accounts and models.},

In 4 experiments, using a function learning paradigm, a binary context variable was paired with the continuous stimulus variable of a to-be-learned function. In the first 2 experiments, when context predicted the slope of a quadratic function, generalization was context specific. Because context did not predict function values, it is suggested that people use context to gate separate learning of simpler partial functions. The 3rd experiment showed that partitioning also occurs with a decreasing linear function, whereas the 4th study showed that partitioning is absent for a linearly increasing function. The results support the notion that people simplify complex learning tasks by acquiring independent parcels of knowledge.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems {\textemdash} false alarms, misses, and inversions {\textemdash} for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates.

  abstract = {Motor learning occurs over long periods of practice during which motor acuity, the ability to execute actions more accurately, precisely, and in less time, improves. Laboratorybased studies of motor learning are typically limited to a small number of participants and a time frame of minutes to several hours per participant. There is a need to assess the generalizability of theories and findings from lab-based motor learning studies on larger samples and time scales. In addition, laboratory-based studies of motor learning use relatively simple motor tasks which participants are unlikely to be intrinsically motivated to learn, limiting the interpretation of their findings in more ecologically valid settings (``in the wild''). We studied the acquisition and longitudinal refinement of a complex sensorimotor skill embodied in a first-person shooter video game scenario, with a large sample size (N = 7174, 682,564 repeats of the 60 s game) over a period of months. Participants voluntarily practiced the gaming scenario for up to several hours per day up to 100 days. We found improvement in performance accuracy (quantified as hit rate) was modest over time but motor acuity (quantified as hits per second) improved considerably, with 40{\textendash}60\% retention from 1 day to the next. We observed steady improvements in motor acuity across multiple days of video game practice, unlike most motor learning tasks studied in the lab that hit a performance ceiling rather quickly. Learning rate was a non-linear function of baseline performance level, amount of daily practice, and to a lesser extent, number of days between practice sessions. In addition, we found that the benefit of additional practice on any given day was nonmonotonic; the greatest improvements in motor acuity were evident with about an hour of practice and 90\% of the learning benefit was achieved by practicing 30 min per day. Taken together, these results provide a proof-of-concept in studying motor skill acquisition outside the confines of the traditional laboratory, in the presence of unmeasured confounds, and provide new insights into how a complex motor skill is acquired in an ecologically valid setting and refined across much longer time scales than typically explored.},

Contrary to that common belief, the authors report 2 experiments that demonstrate that using probabilistic feedback in an intentional categorization task leads to sensitivity to correlations among nondiagnostic cues. Deterministic feedback eliminates correlational sensitivity by focusing attention on relevant cues. Computational modeling reveals that exemplar storage coupled with selective attention is necessary to explain this effect.},

Additionally, studies have focused largely on participants' categorizations of transfer items to determine the representations that they formed. In the present studies, we used a convergent-measures approach to examine participants' categorizations of transfer items in addition to their self-reported learning orientations and response times on transfer items, and in doing so, we garnered evidence that qualitatively distinct approaches in explicit strategies for category learning (i.e., memorization vs. abstracting an articulable rule) and consequent representations might emerge in a single task. Participants categorized instances that followed a categorization rule (in Study~1, we used a relational rule; in Study~2, an additional task with a single-feature rule). Critically, for both tasks,~some transfer items differed from trained instances on only one attribute (but otherwise were perceptually similar), rendering the item a member of the opposing category on the basis of the rule (i.e., termed ambiguous items). Some learners categorized ambiguous items on the basis of perceptual similarity, whereas others categorized them on the basis of an abstracted rule. Self-reported learning orientation (i.e., memorization vs. rule abstraction) predicted categorizations and response times on transfer items. Differences in learning orientations were not associated with performance on other cognitive measures (i.e., working memory capacity and Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices). This work suggests that individuals may have different predispositions toward memorization versus rule abstraction in a single categorization task.},

In one such example, Wills and Mackintosh trained both pigeons and humans to discriminate between two categories of complex patterns comprising overlapping sets of abstract visual features. They demonstrated that pigeons and humans produced similar ``peak-shifted'' generalisation gradients when the proportion of shared features was systemically varied across a set of transfer stimuli, providing support for an elemental feature-based analysis of discrimination and generalisation. Here, we report a series of experiments inspired by this work, investigating the processes involved in post-discrimination generalisation in human category learning. We investigate how post-discrimination generalisation is affected by variability in the spatial arrangement and probability of occurrence of the visual features and develop an associative learning model that builds on Mackintosh's theoretical approach to elemental associative learning.},

  abstract = {Learning of feature-based categories is known to interact with feature-variation in a variety of ways, depending on the type of variation (e.g., Markman \& Maddox, 2003). However, relational categories are distinct from feature-based categories in that they determine membership based on structural similarities. As a result, the way that they interact with feature variation is unclear. This paper explores both experimental and computational data and argues that, despite its reliance on structural factors, relational category-learning should still be affected by the type of feature variation present during the learning process. It specifically suggests that within-feature and across-feature variation should produce different learning trajectories due to a difference in representational cost. The paper then uses the DORA model (Doumas, Hummel, \& Sandhofer, 2008) to discuss how this account might function in a cognitive system before presenting an experiment aimed at testing this account. The experiment was a relational category-learning task and was run on human participants and then simulated in DORA. Both sets of results indicated that learning a relational category from a training set with a lower amount of variation is easier, but that learning from a training set with increased within-feature variation is significantly less challenging than learning from a set with increased across-feature variation. These results sup-port the claim that, like feature-based category-learning, relational category-learning is sensitive to the type of feature variation in the training set.},

Here, we consider the idea that individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) may be usefully modeled in terms of the number of samples, or ``particles,'' available to perform inference. To test this idea, we focus on two recent experiments that report positive associations between WMC and two distinct aspects of categorization performance: the ability to learn novel categories, and the ability to switch between different categorization strategies (``knowledge restructuring''). In favor of the idea of modeling WMC as a number of particles, we show that a single model can reproduce both experimental results by varying the number of particles{\textemdash}increasing the number of particles leads to both faster category learning and improved strategy-switching. Furthermore, when we fit the model to individual participants, we found a positive association between WMC and best-fit number of particles for strategy switching. However, no association between WMC and best-fit number of particles was found for category learning. These results are discussed in the context of the general challenge of disentangling the contributions of different potential sources of behavioral variability.},

This article presents a theory that explains how automatic control is possible in skilled typing, where thinking of a word automatically produces a rapid series of keystrokes. The theory assumes that keystrokes are selected by a context retrieval process that matches the current context to stored contexts and retrieves the key associated with the best match. The current context is generated by the typist's own actions. It represents the goal (``type DOG'') and the motor commands for the keys struck so far. Top-down control is necessary to start typing. It sets the goal in the current context, which initiates the retrieval and updating processes, which continue without top-down control until the word is finished. The theory explains phenomena of hierarchical control in skilled typing, including differential loads on higher and lower levels of processing, the importance of words, and poor explicit knowledge of key locations and finger-to-key mappings. The theory is evaluated by fitting it to error corpora from 24 skilled typists and predicting error probabilities, magnitudes, and patterns. Some of the fits are quite good. The theory has implications beyond typing. It argues that control can be automatic and shows how it is possible. The theory extends to other sequential skills, like texting or playing music. It provides new insights into mechanisms of serial order in typing, speaking, and serial recall.},

  abstract = {This article presents a theory in which automatization is construed as the acquisition of a domain-specific knowledge base, formed of separate representations, instances, of each exposure to the task. Processing is considered automatic if it relies on retrieval of stored instances, which will occur only after practice in a consistent environment. Practice is important because it increases the amount retrieved and the speed of retrieval; consistency is important because it ensures that the retrieved instances will be useful. The theory accounts quantitatively for the power-function speed-up and predicts a power-function reduction in the standard deviation that is constrained to have the same exponent as the power function for the speed-up. The theory accounts for qualitative properties as well, explaining how some may disappear and others appear with practice. More generally, it provides an alternative to the modal view of automaticity.},

  abstract = {The TBRS*C computational model provides a mathematical implementation of the cognitive processes involved in complex span tasks. The logic of the core processes, i.e., encoding, refreshing/time-based decay, and chunking, is based on Hebbian learning, synaptic facilitation, and long-term neural plasticity, respectively. The modeling, however, takes place on a cognitive rather than a~physiological level. Chunking is implemented as a process of searching for~sequences of memoranda in long-term memory and recoding them as a single unit which increases the efficacy of memory maintenance. Using TBRS*C simulations, the present study investigated how chunking and central working memory processes change with expertise. Hobby musicians and music students completed a complex span task in which sequences of twelve note symbols were presented for serial recall of pitch. After the presentation of each memorandum, participants performed an unknown, notated melody on an electric piano. To manipulate the potential for chunking, we varied whether sequences of memoranda formed meaningful tonal structures (major triads) or arbitrary trichords. Hobby musicians and music students were each split up in a higher-expertise and a lower-expertise group and TBRS*C simulations were performed for each group individually. In the simulations, higher-expertise hobby musicians encoded memoranda more rapidly, invested less time in chunk search, and recognized chunks with a higher chance than lower-expertise hobby musicians. Parameter estimates for music students showed only marginal expertise differences. We conclude that expertise in the TBRS model can be conceptualized by a rapid access to long-term memory and by chunking, which leads to an increase in the opportunity and efficacy of refreshing.},

Recent studies have suggested that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) category{\textendash}viewpoint combinations, that is, combinations not seen during training. Here we investigate when and how such OOD generalization may be possible by evaluating CNNs trained to classify both object category and three-dimensional viewpoint on OOD combinations, and identifying the neural mechanisms that facilitate such OOD generalization. We show that increasing the number of in-distribution combinations (data diversity) substantially improves generalization to OOD combinations, even with the same amount of training data. We compare learning category and viewpoint in separate and shared network architectures, and observe starkly different trends on in-distribution and OOD combinations, that is, while shared networks are helpful in distribution, separate networks significantly outperform shared ones at OOD combinations. Finally, we demonstrate that such OOD generalization is facilitated by the neural mechanism of specialization, that is, the emergence of two types of neuron{\textemdash}neurons selective to category and invariant to viewpoint, and vice versa.},

This renders visual perceptual learning distinct from other forms of learning, where generalization can be more easily attained, and therefore unsuitable for practical applications, where generalization is key. Based on the hypotheses derived from the structure of the visual system, we test here whether stimulus variability can unlock generalization in perceptual learning. We train subjects in orientation discrimination, while we vary the amount of variability in a task-irrelevant feature, spatial frequency. We find that, independently of task difficulty, this manipulation enables generalization of learning to new stimuli and locations, while not negatively affecting the overall amount of learning on the task. We then use deep neural networks to investigate how variability unlocks generalization. We find that networks develop invariance to the task-irrelevant feature when trained with variable inputs. The degree of learned invariance strongly predicts generalization. A reliance on invariant representations can explain variability-induced generalization in visual perceptual learning. This suggests new targets for understanding the neural basis of perceptual learning in the higher-order visual cortex and presents an easy-to-implement modification of common training paradigms that may benefit practical applications.},

  abstract = {Human motor adaptation to novel environments is often modeled by a basis function network that transforms desired movement properties into estimated forces. This network employs a layer of nodes that have fixed broad tunings that generalize across the input domain. Learning is achieved by updating the weights of these nodes in response to training experience. This conventional model is unable to account for rapid flexibility observed in human spatial generalization during motor adaptation. However, added plasticity in the widths of the basis function tunings can achieve this flexibility, and several neurophysiological experiments have revealed flexibility in tunings of sensorimotor neurons. We found a model, Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR), which uniquely possesses the structure of a basis function network in which both the weights and tuning widths of the nodes are updated incrementally during adaptation. We presented this LWPR model with training functions of different spatial complexities and monitored incremental updates to receptive field widths. An inverse pattern of dependence of receptive field adaptation on experienced error became evident, underlying both a relationship between generalization and complexity, and a unique behavior in which generalization always narrows after a sudden switch in environmental complexity. These results implicate a model that is flexible in both basis function widths and weights, like LWPR, as a viable alternative model for human motor adaptation that can account for previously observed plasticity in spatial generalization. This theory can be tested by using the behaviors observed in our experiments as novel hypotheses in human studies.},

In studies of short-term adjustment, subjects threw in the direction of their prism-bent gaze, missing the target to that side. Within 10-30 throws, they gradually adapted with a wider gaze-throw angle and hit the target. Immediately after removal of the prisms the wide gaze-throw angle persisted and throws missed the target to the opposite side, the so-called 'negative after effect'. Repeated throws were required to adapt back to the normal gaze-throw angle and hit the target. The adaptation was specific both to the body parts trained and the type of throw trained: training with the right hand did not generalize to throwing with the left; overhand training seldom generalized to underhand throwing. In a study of long-term adjustment, two subjects threw with the same hand (right) and the same type of throw (overhand) alternately, with and without prisms, over a period of 6 weeks. They gradually learned to hit the target on the first throw, with and without prisms. The two gaze-throw calibrations (prism and no-prism) were retained for {$>$} 27 months. The long-term adjustment was shown to consist of a coordinated relationship of eye-in-head, head-on-trunk and trunk-on-arm angles.},

One claim is that a general skill independent of specific training instances is involved, and the other is that skill is based on memory for the analysis of specific instances encountered during training. Contrary to the general skill view, a series of experiments with 64 university students demonstrated that transfer of word identification skill was highly specific and occurred only when training and test instances shared common letters printed in the same case (i.e., uppercase or lowercase). Transfer of skill also depended on the visual patterns formed by adjacent letters and word shape. Presentation of a word in training and test phases significantly improved test phase identification of that word even when a unique visual pattern was used. It is concluded that these results are compatible with an instance-based view of word identification skill in which it is assumed that Ss develop skilled analysis of the visual and conceptual characteristics of specific words, and that this skill can be used to identify repeatedly presented words as well as predictable sets of novel words.

Recently, however, the validity of gradient descent as a descriptive model of real human cognitive processes has been criticized. In the present paper, we introduce a new framework for descriptive models of human learning that offers qualitatively plausible interpretations of cognitive behaviors. Specifically, we apply a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm as a learning method for modeling human category learning, where the definition of the learning objective is not based solely on the accuracy of knowledge, but also on the subjectively and contextually determined utility of knowledge being acquired. In addition, unlike gradient descent, our model assumes that humans entertain multiple hypotheses and learn not only by modifying a single existing hypothesis but also by combining a set of hypotheses. This learning-by-combination has been empirically supported, but largely overlooked in computational modeling research. Simulation studies show that our new modeling framework successfully replicated important observed psychological phenomena.},

  abstract = {Studies on plasticity in motor function have shown that motor learning generalizes, such that movements in novel situations are affected by previous training. It has been shown that the pattern of generalization for visuomotor rotation learning changes when training movements are made to a wide distribution of directions. Here we have found that for dynamics learning, the shape of the generalization gradient is not similarly modifiable by the extent of training within the workspace. Subjects learned to control a robotic device during training and we measured how subsequent movements in a reference direction were affected. Our results show that as the angular separation between training and test directions increased, the extent of generalization was reduced. When training involved multiple targets throughout the workspace, the extent of generalization was no greater than following training to the nearest target alone. Thus a wide range of experience compensating for a dynamics perturbation provided no greater benefit than localized training. Instead, generalization was complete when training involved targets that bounded the reference direction. This suggests that broad generalization of dynamics learning to movements in novel directions depends on interpolation between instances of localized learning.},

While previous work has hinted to the existence of an internal model of attention, it is still unknown how rich and flexible this model is, whether it corresponds to one's own attention or alternatively to a generic person-invariant schema, and whether it is specified as a list of facts and rules, or alternatively as a probabilistic simulation model. To this end, we designed a task to test participants' ability to estimate their own behavior in a visual search task with novel displays. In four online experiments (two exploratory and two preregistered), prospective search time estimates reflected accurate metacognitive knowledge of key findings in the visual search literature, including the set-size effect, higher efficiency of featureover conjunction- searches, and visual search asymmetry for familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. We further find that participants' estimates fit better with their own search times compared to the search times of other participants. Together, we interpret our findings as suggesting that people hold an internal model of visual search that is rich, person specific, and mostly accurate.},

  abstract = {We describe a distributed model of information processing and memory and apply it to the representation of general and specific information. The model consists of a large number of simple processing elements which send excitatory and inhibitory signals to each other via modifiable connections. Information processing is thought of as the process whereby patterns of activation are formed over the units in the model through their excitatory and inhibitory interactions. The memory trace of a processing event is the change or increment to the strengths of the interconnections that results from the processing event. The traces of separate events are superimposed on each other in the values of the connection strengths that result from the entire set of traces stored in the memory. The model is applied to a number of findings related to the question of whether we store abstract representations or an enumeration of specific experiences in memory. The model simulates the results of a number of important experiments which have been taken as evidence for the enumeration of specific experiences. At the same time, it shows how the functional equivalent of abstract representations{\textemdash}prototypes, logogens, and even rules{\textemdash}can emerge from the superposition of traces of specific experiences, when the conditions are right for this to happen. In essence, the model captures the structure present in a set of input patterns; thus, it behaves as though it had learned prototypes or rules, to the extent that the structure of the environment it has learned about can be captured by describing it in terms of these abstractions.},

When items are massed, it may help the learner to discover the relationship between instances, leading to better abstraction of the underlying concept. Two experiments addressed this question through a typical function learning task in which subjects were trained via presentations of input points (cue values) for which output responses (criterion values) were required. Subjects were trained either using spaced points, strategically massed points (points were paired in training such that they occurred on the same side of the underlying V-shaped function), or randomly massed points (points were randomly paired during training). All subjects were then tested on repeated training points, new (interpolation) points within the training range, and extrapolation points that fell outside the training range. Spacing led to superior interpolation and extrapolation performance, with random massing leading to the worst performance on all test trial types. These results suggest that, at least for function concepts, massed training is not superior to spaced training for concept learning.},

Supporting this distinction, after training (on a function-learning task), participants displayed an extrapolation profile reflecting either acquisition of the trained cue-criterion associations (exemplar learners) or abstraction of the function rule (rule learners; Studies 1a and 1b). Further, working memory capacity (measured by operation span [Ospan]) was associated with the tendency to rely on rule versus exemplar processes. Studies 1c and 2 examined the persistence of these learning tendencies on several categorization tasks. Study 1c showed that rule learners were more likely than exemplar learners (indexed a priori by extrapolation profiles) to resist using idiosyncratic features (exemplar similarity) in generalization (transfer) of the trained category. Study 2 showed that the rule learners but not the exemplar learners performed well on a novel categorization task (transfer) after training on an abstract coherent category. These patterns suggest that in complex conceptual tasks, (a) individuals tend to either focus on exemplars during learning or on extracting some abstraction of the concept, (b) this tendency might be a relatively stable characteristic of the individual, and (c) transfer patterns are determined by that tendency.},

We extended these findings to introductory biology courses in which active-learning techniques were used to try to foster deep conceptual learning. Exams were constructed to contain both transfer and retention questions. Abstraction learners demonstrated better performance than exemplar learners on the transfer questions but not on the retention questions. These results were not moderated by indices of crystallized or fluid intelligence. Our central interpretation is that students identified as abstraction learners appear to construct a deep understanding of the concepts (presumably based on abstract underpinnings), thereby enabling them to apply and generalize the concepts to scenarios and instantiations not seen during instruction (transfer questions). By contrast, other students appear to base their representations on memorized instructed examples, leading to good performance on retention questions but not transfer questions.},

Transfer incorporates a linear rule-based response mechanism (McDaniel \& Busemeyer, 2005). Learners were trained on a functional relationship defined by 2 linear-function segments with mirror slopes. In Experiment 1, 1 segment was densely trained and 1 was sparsely trained; in Experiment 2, both segments were trained equally, but the 2 segments were widely separated. Transfer to new input values was tested. For each model, training performance for each individual participant was fit, and transfer predictions were generated. POLE generally better fit the training data than did EXAM, but EXAM was more accurate at predicting (and fitting) transfer behaviors. It was especially telling that in Experiment 2 the transfer pattern was more consistent with EXAM's but not POLE's predictions, even though the presentation of salient linear segments during training dovetailed with POLE's approach.},

The model captures choices and RTs at various stages of learning, and in learning environments with varying complexity. Moreover, the model generalizes from tasks with deterministic reward contingencies to probabilistic ones. The model succeeds in part by incorporating prior uncertainty over actions when modeling RT.

Here, we test whether the extent of variation is critical to this improvement, by manipulating the degree of within-identity variation that participants are exposed to in a sequential matching test. Participants were more accurate and adopted more liberal response criteria, when matching high-variability pairs to probe images, compared with either low-variability pairs or single images. Importantly, benefits of variation are not explained by independent contributions of single images, suggesting that people extrapolate information across images to produce gains in identification accuracy.

The difference in performance across the three contexts, as well as the benefit of the rule-based order observed in two out of three experiments, were mostly detected by the segmentation/clustering method. Furthermore, the analysis of the segmentation/clustering outputs using the backward learning curve revealed that participants' performance suddenly improved, suggesting the detection of an ``eureka'' moment.

  abstract = {This study simultaneously manipulates within-category (rule-based vs.~similarity-based), between-category (blocked vs.~interleaved), and across-blocks (constant vs.~variable) orders to investigate how different types of presentation order interact with one another. With regard to within-category orders, stimuli were presented either in a ``rule plus exceptions'' fashion (in the rule-based order) or by maximizing the similarity between contiguous examples (in the similarity-based order). As for the between-category manipulation, categories were either blocked (in the blocked order) or alternated (in the interleaved order). Finally, the sequence of stimuli was either repeated (in the constant order) or varied (in the variable order) across blocks. This research offers a novel approach through both an individual and concurrent analysis of the studied factors, with the investigation of across-blocks manipulations being unprecedented. We found a significant interaction between within-category and across-blocks orders, as well as between between-category and across-blocks orders. In particular, the combination similarity-based + variable orders was the most detrimental, whereas the combination blocked + constant was the most beneficial. We also found a main effect of across-blocks manipulation, with faster learning in the constant order as compared to the variable one. With regard to the classification of novel stimuli, learners in the rule-based and interleaved orders showed generalization patterns that were more consistent with a specific rule-based strategy, as compared to learners in the similarity-based and blocked orders, respectively. This study shows that different types of order can interact in a subtle fashion and thus should not be considered in isolation.},

However, a vast array of studies have shown that the sequence received during learning can influence how categories are formed. In this paper, the objective was to better account for effects of serial order. We developed a model called Ordinal General Context Model (OGCM) based on the Generalized Context Model (GCM), which we modified to incorporate ordinal information. OGCM incorporates serial order as a feature along ordinary physical features, allowing it to account for the effect of sequential order as a form of distortion of the feature space. The comparison between the models showed that integrating serial order during learning in the OGCM provided the best account of classification of the stimuli in our data sets.},

Recently, evidence accumulation models (EAMs) of decision-making and reinforcement learning (RL) models of errordriven learning have been combined into joint RL-EAMs that can in principle address these interactions. However, we show that the most commonly used combination, based on the diffusion decision model (DDM) for binary choice, consistently fails to capture crucial aspects of response times observed during reinforcement learning. We propose a new RL-EAM based on an advantage racing diffusion (ARD) framework for choices among two or more options that not only addresses this problem but captures stimulus difficulty, speed-accuracy trade-off, and stimulus-responsemapping reversal effects. The RL-ARD avoids fundamental limitations imposed by the DDM on addressing effects of absolute values of choices, as well as extensions beyond binary choice, and provides a computationally tractable basis for wider applications.},

Recent work focusing on spelling-to-sound correspondences in English proposes that a graded ``warping'' mechanism determines the extent to which the pronunciation of a newly learned word should generalize to its orthographic neighbors. We explored the micro-structure of this proposal by training a network to pronounce new made-up words that were consistent with the dominant pronunciation (regulars), were comprised of a completely unfamiliar pronunciation (exceptions), or were consistent with a subordinate pronunciation in English (ambiguous). Crucially, by training the same spelling-to-sound mapping with either one or multiple items, we tested whether variation in adjacent, within-item context made a given pronunciation more able to generalize. This is exactly what we found. Context variability, therefore, appears to act as a modulator of the warping in quasiregular domains.},

We refer to this as indirect category learning, because the task and the feedback were not directly related to category membership, yet category learning was necessary for good performance in the task. In the first experiment, we compared the performance of participants who learned the categories indirectly with the performance of participants who first learned to classify the objects. In the second experiment, we replicated the basic findings and examined attention to different features during the learning task. In both experiments, participants who learned in the prediction-only condition displayed a broader distribution of attention than participants who learned in the classification-and-prediction condition did. Some participants in the prediction-only group learned the family resemblance structure of the categories, even when a perfect criterial attribute was present. In contrast, participants who first learned to classify the objects tended to learn the criterial attribute.},

In three experiments, participants were trained on 12 categories of rocks, either without or with a brief description highlighting key features of each category. After training, they were tested on their ability to categorize both old and new rocks from each of the categories. Providing feature descriptions as a caption under a rock image failed to improve category learning relative to providing only the rock image with its category label (Experiment 1). However, when these same feature descriptions were presented such that they were explicitly linked to the relevant parts of the rock image (feature highlighting), participants showed significantly higher performance on both immediate generalization to new rocks (Experiment 2) and generalization after a 2-day delay (Experiment 3). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Toward this end, we decomposed a cognitive model into neuron-like units using a neural flocking approach that parallels recurrent hippocampal activity. Neural flocking coordinates units that collectively form higher-level mental constructs. The decomposed model suggested how brain-scale neural populations coordinate to form assemblies encoding concept and spatial representations and why so many neurons are needed for robust performance at the cognitive level. This multilevel explanation provides a way to understand how cognition and symbol-like representations are supported by coordinated neural populations (assemblies) formed through learning.},

There are disagreements in the literature whether amount or diversity is the more critical measure of the input. Here we analyze the properties of a large corpus (6.5 million words) of speech to children and simulate learning environments that differ in amount of talk per unit time, lexical diversity, and the contexts of talk. The central conclusion is that what researchers need to theoretically understand, measure, and change is not the total amount of words, or the diversity of words, but the function that relates total words to the diversity of words, and how that function changes across different contexts of talk.},

Observers tend to know when novel objects are in the same class despite large differences in shape, material or viewpoint. A major challenge in studying such generalization is that participants can see each novel sample only once. To overcome this, we used crowdsourcing to obtain responses from 500 human observers on 20 novel object classes, with each stimulus compared to 1 or 16 related objects. The results reveal that humans generalize from sparse data in highly systematic ways with the number and variance of the samples. We compared human responses to `ShapeComp', an image-computable model based on {$>$}100 shape descriptors, and `AlexNet', a convolution neural network that roughly matches humans at recognizing 1000 categories of real-world objects. With 16 samples, the models were consistent with human responses without free parameters. Thus, when there are a sufficient number of samples, observers rely on shallow but efficient processes based on a fixed set of features. With 1 sample, however, the models required different feature weights for each object. This suggests that one-shot categorization involves more sophisticated processes that actively identify the unique characteristics underlying each object class.},

Because movement errors decreased exponentially across trials in both learning tasks, optimal target selection (task 1) and optimal reward structure selection (task 2) required taking into account future performance. The results from both tasks indicate that people anticipate their future motor performance so as to make decisions that will improve their expected future reward.},

Results  We first give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modeling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be fitted using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions  Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for statistical modeling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).

After training, human responses closely correspond to these functional relationships. Here we study how humans predict unobserved segments of a function that they have been trained on and we compare how human predictions differ to those made by various function-learning models in the literature. Participants' performance was best predicted by the polynomial functions that generated the observations. Further, participants were able to explicitly report the correct generating function in most cases upon a post-experiment survey. This suggests that humans can abstract functions. To understand how they do so, we modeled human learning using an hierarchical Bayesian framework organized at two levels of abstraction: function learning and parameter learning, and used it to understand the time course of participants' learning as we surreptitiously changed the generating function over time. This Bayesian model selection framework allowed us to analyze the time course of function learning and parameter learning in relative isolation. We found that participants acquired new functions as they changed and even when parameter learning was not completely accurate, the probability that the correct function was learned remained high. Most importantly, we found that humans selected the simplest-fitting function with the highest probability and that they acquired simpler functions faster than more complex ones. Both aspects of this behavior, extent and rate of selection, present evidence that human function learning obeys the Occam's razor principle.},

We analyze a data set covering 88 individuals who worked on 5,711 maintenance tasks in an offshore software support services operation. We find that, as expected, specialization enhances productivity. However, exposure to variety has a nonlinear influence on productivity; i.e., ``too much variety'' can impede learning. We also find that achieving a proper balance between specialization and exposure to a variety leads to the highest productivity. We capture this balance using an adaptation of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index from the economics literature. In addition, we examine how the productivity of individuals in a workgroup is affected by member entry and exit, with the latter specified in terms of the degree of specialized experience and the degree of variety experience lost from the workgroup when a member exits.

  abstract = {Distributed population codes are ubiquitous in the brain and pose a challenge to downstream neurons that must learn an appropriate readout. Here we explore the possibility that this learning problem is simplified through inductive biases implemented by stimulus-independent noise correlations that constrain learning to task-relevant dimensions. We test this idea in a set of neural networks that learn to perform a perceptual discrimination task. Correlations among similarly tuned units were manipulated independently of an overall population signal-to-noise ratio to test how the format of stored information affects learning. Higher noise correlations among similarly tuned units led to faster and more robust learning, favoring homogenous weights assigned to neurons within a functionally similar pool, and could emerge through Hebbian learning. When multiple discriminations were learned simultaneously, noise correlations across relevant feature dimensions sped learning, whereas those across irrelevant feature dimensions slowed it. Our results complement the existing theory on noise correlations by demonstrating that when such correlations are produced without significant degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio, they can improve the speed of readout learning by constraining it to appropriate dimensions.

In particular we focus on the comparison between people's behavior in a changing environment and their behavior in an unchanging one. Our experimental work is motivated by rational analysis of the problem that makes strong predictions about information search and reward seeking in static and changeable environments. Our results show a striking agreement between human behavior and the optimal policy, but also highlight a number of systematic differences. In particular, we find that while people often employ suboptimal strategies the first time they encounter the learning problem, most people are able to approximate the correct strategy after minimal experience. In order to describe both the manner in which people's choices are similar to but slightly different from an optimal standard, we introduce four process models for the observe or bet task and evaluate them as potential theories of human behavior.},

Using the visually-guided paradigm, some have argued that the resulting retuning effect is specific to the phonetic context in which it is learned; which in turn has been used to argue that such retuning targets context-dependent sub-lexical units. We use three new experiments to study the generalizable nature of lexically-guided perceptual learning of fricative consonants and how type variation in the training stimuli affects it. In contrast to visually-guided retuning, we show that lexical retuning does generalize to new phonetic contexts, particularly when listeners are trained with type variation. This suggests that there is an abstract context-independent representation that is used in speech perception and during lexical retuning. While the same generalization is not clearly observed when type variation is eliminated, the lack of a clear interaction effect between training types prevents us from inferring that lexically-guided perceptual learning needs type variation within the training stimuli to generalize to new phonetic contexts. Furthermore, we point out that some of these effects are subtle and are only observable if we take into account pre-training group difference between the control and test groups.},

The question of generalization of network performance from a finite training set to unseen data is clearly of crucial importance. In this article we first show that the generalization error can be decomposed into two terms: the approximation error, due to the insufficient representational capacity of a finite sized network, and the estimation error, due to insufficient information about the target function because of the finite number of samples. We then consider the problem of learning functions belonging to certain Sobolev spaces with gaussian radial basis functions. Using the above-mentioned decomposition we bound the generalization error in terms of the number of basis functions and number of examples. While the bound that we derive is specific for radial basis functions, a number of observations deriving from it apply to any approximation technique. Our result also sheds light on ways to choose an appropriate network architecture for a particular problem and the kinds of problems that can be effectively solved with finite resources, i.e., with a finite number of parameters and finite amounts of data.},

In this experiment, we aimed to extend literature around the contextual interference effect by investigating whether the way the follow-through is organised in practice affects learning of the backhand shot in table tennis. Thirty unskilled participants were allocated to blocked-variable practice, random-variable practice or a control-constant group and aimed backhand shots towards a target following ball projection from a machine. Each group completed these shots in a pre-test, a training phase with follow-through manipulations, a post-test, and a retention test. The random-variable group improved their shot accuracy from pre-test to post-test and from pre-test to retention test (both P {$<$} 0.01, d = 1.03), whereas neither the blocked-variable nor the control-constant group displayed any change in shot accuracy. Practising the follow-through in a random-variable fashion enhanced learning of the preceding shot compared with blocked-variable practice or no follow-through instructions. The benefits of learning motor skills under conditions of high contextual interference also apply to how follow-through actions are organised. The findings are valuable to coaches and suggest that instructions related to the follow-through action should be considered as well as the primary skill itself.},

A crucial assumption in the model is that because of selective attention to component dimensions, similarity relations may change in systematic ways across different experimental contexts. The theoretical analysis provided evidence that, at least under unspeeded conditions, selective attention may play a critical role in determining the identification-categorization relationship for integral stimuli. Evidence was also provided that similarity among exemplars decreased as a function of identification learning. Various alternative classification models, including prototype, multiple-prototype, average distance, and "value-on-dimensions" models, were unable to account for the results.

The categorization model, which generalizes the context theory of classification developed by D. L. Medin and M. M. Schaffer (see record 1979-12633-001), assumes that Ss store category exemplars in memory. Classification decisions are based on the similarity of stimuli to the stored exemplars. It is assumed that the same multidimensional perceptual representation underlies performance in both the identification and categorization paradigms. However, because of the influence of selective attention, similarity relationships change systematically across the 2 paradigms. Findings provide some support for the hypothesis that Ss distribute attention among component dimensions so as to optimize categorization performance and that Ss may have augmented their category representations with inferred exemplars. Results demonstrate that excellent predictions of categorization performance can be made given knowledge of performance in an identification paradigm.},

In this chapter, I review recent work showing that the model also accounts accurately for RT and choice-probability data in a wide variety of probe-recognition, short-term, memory-search paradigms. According to the model, observers store items from study lists as individual exemplars in memory. When a test probe is presented, it causes the exemplars to be retrieved. The exemplars that are most readily retrieved are those that are highly similar to the test probe and that have the greatest memory strengths. The retrieved exemplars drive a familiarity-based evidence-accumulation process that determines the speed and accuracy of old{\textendash}new recognition decisions. The model accounts for effects of memory-set size, old-new status of test probe, and study-test lag; effects of the detailed similarity structure of the memory set; and the role of the history of previously experienced memory sets on performance. Applications of the model reveal a quantitative law of how memory strength varies with the retention interval. In addition, the model provides a unified account of how probe recognition operates in cases involving short and long study lists. Furthermore~it provides an account of the classic distinction between controlled versus automatic processing depending on the types of memory-search practice in which observers engage. In short~the model brings together and extends prior research and theory on categorization, attention and automaticity, short- and long-term memory, and evidence-accumulation models of choice RT to move the field closer to a unified account of diverse forms of memory search.},

The phenomena include various rule- and prototype-described patterns of generalization, dis- sociations between categorization and similarity judgments, and dissociations between categorization and old-new recognition. The alternative exemplar-based interpretation relies on the idea that simi- larity is not an invariant relation but a context-dependent one. Similarity relations among exemplars change systematically because of selective attention to dimensions and because of changes in the level of sensitivity relating judged similarity to distance in psychological space. Adaptive learning principles may help explain the systematic influence of the selective attention process and of modulation in sen- sitivity settings on judged similarity.},

The model combines elements of R. M. Nosofsky's (1986) generalized context model of categorization and G. D. Logan's (1988) instance-based model of automaticity. In the model, exemplars race among one another to be retrieved from memory, with rates determined by their similarity to test items. The retrieved exemplars provide incremental information that enters into a random walk process for making classification decisions. The model predicts correctly effects of within- and between-categories similarity, individual-object familiarity, and extended practice on classification response times. It also builds bridges between the domains of categorization and automaticity. Models of multidimensional perceptual classification have grown increasingly powerful and sophisticated in recent years, providing detailed quantitative accounts of patterns of classification learning, transfer, and generalization (e.g., Anderson,},

The EBRW model is a member of the class of exemplar models. According to such models, people represent categories by storing individual exemplars of the categories in memory, and classify objects on the basis of their similarity to the stored exemplars. The EBRW model combines ideas ranging from the fields of choice and similarity, to the development of automaticity, to response-time models of evidence accumulation and decision-making. This integrated model explains relations between categorization and other fundamental cognitive processes, including individual-object identification, the development of expertise in tasks of skilled performance, and old-new recognition memory. Furthermore, it provides an account of how categorization and recognition decision-making unfold through time. We also provide comparisons with some other process models of categorization.},

Also, making connections to the literature on attention and visual search, the model was used to interpret differences in probe-recognition performance across diverse conditions that manipulated relations between targets and foils across trials. Subjects saw lists of from 1 to 16 items followed by a single item recognition probe. In a varied-mapping condition, targets and foils could switch roles across trials; in a consistent-mapping condition, targets and foils never switched roles; and in an all-new condition, on each trial a completely new set of items formed the memory set. In the varied-mapping and all-new conditions, mean correct response times (RTs) and error proportions were curvilinear increasing functions of memory set size, with the RT results closely resembling ones from hybrid visual-memory search experiments reported by Wolfe (2012). In the consistent-mapping condition, new-probe RTs were invariant with set size, whereas old-probe RTs increased slightly with increasing study{\textendash}test lag. With appropriate choice of psychologically interpretable free parameters, the model accounted well for the complete set of results. The work provides support for the hypothesis that a common set of processes involving exemplar-based familiarity may govern long-term and short-term probe recognition across wide varieties of memory- search conditions.},

The type of mapping often produces markedly different performance patterns, but formal memory-based models that account quantitatively for detailed aspects of the results have not yet been developed and evaluated. Experiments were conducted to test a modern exemplar-retrieval model on its ability to account for memory-search performance involving a wide range of memory-set sizes in both varied-mapping (VM) and consistent-mapping (CM) probe-recognition tasks. The model formalized the idea that both familiarity-based and categorization-based processes operate. The model was required to fit detailed response-time (RT) distributions of individual, highly practiced subjects. A key manipulation involved the repetition of negative probes across trials. This manipulation produced a dramatic dissociation: False-alarm rates increased and correct-rejection RTs got longer in VM, but not in CM. The qualitative pattern of results and modeling analyses provided evidence for a strong form of categorization-based processing in CM, in which observers made use of the membership of negative probes in the ``new'' category to make old{\textendash}new recognition decisions.},

In Experiment 1, distinctive old items were defined as those lying in isolated regions of a continuous-dimension similarity space. In this case, any beneficial effects of distinctiveness were absent or small, regardless of the structure of the test list used to assess recognition memory. In Experiment 2, distinctive items were defined as those objects containing certain discrete, individuating features. In this case, large old-item distinctive effects were observed, with the nature of the effects being modulated by the structure of the test lists. A hybrid-similarity exemplar model, combining elements of continuous-dimension distance and discrete-feature matching, was used to account for these distinctiveness effects in the recognition data. According to global-activation models of old{\textendash}new recognition memory, observers make recognition judgments on the basis of the overall familiarity of test objects. Presentation of a test object is assumed to give rise to a global activation of information stored in memory. The greater this global activation, the greater is the sense of familiarity associated with the object, and so the greater is the probability with which an observer judges the object to be old},

The main goal is to provide some quantitative tests of ALEX and demonstrate that it performs well in situations in which the context model has performed well. It also discusses the advantages that are yielded by elaborating the context model as an exemplar-based network.

This past research was limited, however, either because authentic science categories were not tested, or because the procedures did not allow participants to form strong associations between subtype-level and high-level category names. Here we investigate a two-stage response-training procedure in which participants provide both a high-level and subtype-level response on most trials, with feedback provided at both levels. The procedure is tested in experiments in which participants learn to classify large sets of rocks that are representative of those taught in geoscience classes.},

Under typical training conditions, observers showed little sensitivity to the attribute interactions, thereby challenging the predictions from the exemplar models. In a condition involving highly extended training, observers eventually learned the relations between the attribute interactions and the criterion variable. However, an analysis of the observers ' response times for making their paired-comparison decisions also challenged the exemplar model predictions. Instead, it appeared that most observers recoded the interacting attributes into emergent configural cues.

The specific domain of inquiry is rock classification in the geologic sciences; the goal is to use the model to search for optimal training examples for teaching the rock categories. On the positive side, the model makes a number of successful predictions: Most notably, compared with conditions involving focused training on small sets of training examples, generalization to novel transfer items is significantly enhanced in a condition in which learners experience a broad swath of training examples from each category. Nevertheless, systematic departures from the model predictions are also observed. Further analyses lead us to the hypothesis that the high-dimensional featurespace representation derived for the rock stimuli (to which the exemplar model makes reference) systematically underestimates within-category similarities. We suggest that this limitation is likely to arise in numerous situations in which investigators attempt to build detailed feature-space representations for naturalistic categories. A low-parameter extended version of the model that adjusts for this limitation provides dramatically improved accounts of performance across the four conditions. We outline future steps for enhancing the current feature-space representation and continuing our goal of using formal psychological models to guide the search for effective methods of teaching science categories.},

Error RTs were nearly invariant with set size and lag, consistent with the idea that the errors were produced by a stimulusindependent guessing process. The patterns of error and RT data could not be explained in terms of encoding limitations, but were consistent with the hypothesis that long retention lags produced a zero-stimulus-information state that required guessing. Formal modeling of the change-detection RT and error data pointed toward a hybrid model of visual working memory. The hybrid model assumed mixed states involving a combination of memory and guessing, but with higher memory resolution for items with shorter retention lags.

At the same time, a recurring theme has been to use exemplar models to account for old-new item recognition and to explain relations between classification and recognition. However, a major gap in research is that the models have not been tested on their ability to provide a theoretical account of RTs and other aspects of performance in the classic  short-term memory-scanning paradigm, perhaps the most venerable of all recognition-RT tasks. The present research fills that gap by demonstrating that the EBRW model accounts in natural fashion for a wide variety of phenomena involving diverse forms of short-term memory scanning. The upshot is that similar cognitive operating principles may underlie the domains of multidimensional classification and short-term, old-new recognition.},

  abstract = {This article proposes that patterns of proximity data that have been character- ized in terms of ``asymmetric similarity'' may be alternatively characterized in terms of differential ``bias.'' Bias is a characteristic pertaining to an individual object, as opposed to similarity, which is a relation between two objects. It is proposed that biases can be stimulus based as well as response based, and nu- merous examples are provided. Part 1 of the article reviews an additive similarity and bias model proposed by Holman (1979,Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 20, l-15), which generalizes various extant models that have successfully char- acterized asymmetric proximities. Part 1 then discusses relations between asym- metric proximities and differences in self-proximities, and also discusses multidi- mensional scaling models that are supplemented with stimulus bias terms. Part 2 of the article reviews and integrates a variety of phenomena in the perceptual classification literature involving asymmetries that can be characterized in terms of symmetric similarity together with differential stimulus bias. Part 3 provides examples of limitations of the additive similarity and bias model. A main thesis of the article is that models of proximity and classification data that incorporate properties of the individual stimulus may not always require recourse to the positing of asymmetric similarities. 0 1991Academic PESS, Inc.},

The experiments manipulated the distribution of training instances during an initial study phase, and then tested for correct classification and generalization performance during a transfer phase. The similarity structure of the to-be-learned categories was also manipulated across the experiments. A low-parameter version of an exemplar-memory model, used in combination with a high-dimensional feature-space representation for the rock stimuli, provided good overall accounts of the categorization data. The successful accounts included (a) predicting how performance on individual item types within the categories varied with the distributions of training examples, (b) predicting the overall levels of classification accuracy across the different rock categories, and (c) predicting the patterns of between-category confusions that arose when classification errors were made. The work represents a promising initial step in scaling up the application of formal models of perceptual classification learning to complex natural-category domains. We discuss further steps for making use of the model and its associated feature-space representation to search for effective techniques of teaching categories in the science classroom.},

It was assumed that items that maximally instantiated the rule were those farthest from the category boundary that separated small and large stimuli.

A total of 8752 men and women aged 13{\textendash}89 completed a lifestyle survey and five 45-s games (each game was a block of {\textasciitilde}46 trials) of an online flanker task. Accuracy of the congruent and incongruent flanker stimuli was analyzed using latent class and growth curve modeling adjusting for time between blocks, whether the blocks occurred on the same or different days, education, smoking, sleep, caffeinated coffee and tea use, and Lumosity training status (``free play'' or part of a ``daily brain workout''). Aerobic and resistance exercise were unrelated to first block accuracies. For the more cognitively demanding incongruent flanker stimuli, aerobic activity was positively related to the linear increase in accuracy [B=0.577\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.112 to 1.25 per day above the weekly mean of 2.8 days] and inversely related to the quadratic deceleration of accuracy gains (B=-0.619\% CI, -1.117 to -0.121 per day). An interaction of aerobic activity with age indicated that active participants younger than age 45 had a larger linear increase and a smaller quadratic deceleration compared to other participants. Age moderates the association between self-reported aerobic, but not self-reported resistance, exercise and changes in cognitive control that occur with practice during incongruent presentations across five blocks of a 45-s online, flanker task.

A computer simulation model that embodies the theory learns cognitive skills in ecologically valid domains. The theory generates novel and testable predictions about error correction.

The present work examines whether providing people with a learning opportunity makes them sensitive to the correlation between assets. In two studies, where participants repeatedly allocated their endowment to three assets with feedback, participants changed their portfolio over time dependent on the asset correlation. To model learning about relevant characteristics of a portfolio, we developed reinforcement learning models that take learning about asset variability and correlation into account. We demonstrated via out-ofsample predictions that these models explain portfolio allocations better than basic reinforcement learning models, a static 1/N diversification strategy, and the mean-variance model using sample means, variances, and correlation. Hence, experiencing returns can help investors take asset correlations into account. The principles of reinforcement learning are a cognitively plausible and descriptively valid framework for understanding repeated portfolio allocations.},

Despite the prevalence of this decline, there is a lack of consensus on the mechanism responsible. Three hypotheses have been put forward: (1) interference is caused by learning of test items (2) the test items cause a shift in the context representation used to cue memory and (3) participants change their speed-accuracy thresholds through the course of testing. We implemented all three possibilities in a combined model of recognition memory and decision making, which inherits the memory retrieval elements of the Osth and Dennis (2015) model and uses the diffusion decision model (DDM: Ratcliff, 1978) to generate choice and response times. We applied the model to four datasets that represent three challenges, the findings that: (1) the number of test items plays a larger role in determining performance than the number of studied items, (2) performance decreases less for strong items than weak items in pure lists but not in mixed lists, and (3) lexical decision trials interspersed between recognition test trials do not increase the rate at which performance declines. Analysis of the model's parameter estimates suggests that item interference plays a weak role in explaining the effects of recognition testing, while context drift plays a very large role. These results are consistent with prior work showing a weak role for item noise in recognition memory and that retrieval is a strong cause of context change in episodic memory.},

Twenty-four participants were divided into three groups with different practice conditions (constant, varied distance of the target, and varied angle of the target) and for 5 days performed a task of throwing for precision to a target. Pre-, post-, and transfer tests were used to evaluate our hypothesis. The results showed that although the group measures could predict certain aspects of the transfer tests, the coordination function characteristics were required to show higher levels of explanatory power.

  abstract = {In order to be adaptive, cognition requires knowledge about the statistical structure of the environment. We show that decision performance and the selection between cue-based and exemplar-based inference mechanisms can depend critically on how this knowledge is acquired. Two types of learning tasks are distinguished: learning by comparison, by which the decision maker learns which of two objects has a higher criterion value, and direct criterion learning, by which the decision maker learns an object's criterion value directly. In three experiments, participants were trained either with learning by comparison or with direct criterion learning and subsequently tested with paired-comparison, classification, and estimation tasks. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that although providing less information, learning by comparison led to better generalization (at test), both when generalizing to new objects and when the task format at test differed from the task format during training. Moreover, learning by comparison enabled participants to provide rather accurate continuous estimates. Computational modeling suggests that the advantage of learning by comparison is due to differences in strategy selection: whereas direct criterion learning fosters the reliance on exemplar processing, learning by comparison fosters cue-based mechanisms. The pattern in decision performance reversed when the task environment was changed from a linear (Experiments 1 and 2) to a nonlinear structure (Experiment 3), where direct criterion learning led to better decisions. Our results demonstrate the critical impact of learning conditions for the subsequent selection of decision strategies and highlight the key role of comparison processes in cognition.},

Although movement variability is important in motor memory consolidation, its role is not fully understood in redundant tasks where variability can exist along two orthogonal subspaces (the 'task space' and the 'null space') that have different effects on task performance. Here, we used haptic perturbations to augment variability in these different spaces and examined their effect on motor memory consolidation. Participants learned a shuffleboard task, where they held a bimanual manipulandum and made a discrete throwing motion to slide a virtual puck towards a target. The task was redundant because the distance travelled by the puck was determined by the sum of the left and right hand speeds at release. After participants practiced the task, we used haptic perturbations to introduce motor variability in the task space or null space and examined consolidation of the original task on the next day. We found that regardless of the amplitude, augmenting variability in the task space resulted in significantly better consolidation relative to augmenting variability in the null space, but was not different from a control group that practiced with no variability. This benefit of increasing task space variability relative to increasing null space variability was likely due to the fact that it did not disrupt the pre-existing coordination strategy. These results suggest that the effects of variability on motor memory consolidation depend on the interplay between the induced variability and the pre-existing coordination strategy.},

To adapt the information provided by the pre-trained language models, more approaches based on feature extraction or fine-tuning were tried. However, according to our experiments, integrating these two options in a stack-and-finetune approach seems to be more appropriate for our task. Regarding the comparison of language models in terms of model distillation, we notice that distillation does not affect the effectiveness while significantly reducing the training time. We conclude that the model complexity should be adjusted to the specifics of the analyzed problem and the distillation is an efficient option for low complexity corpora without considerably affecting the overall performance.},

Such empirical 􏱤ndings can prove theoretically challenging to exemplar-based models of categorization if prototypes are psychological central tendencies of category instances. We found instead that category prototypes were sometimes better characterized as psychological extreme points relative to contrast categories. Extending a classic and widely cited study (Posner \& Keele, 1968), participants learned categories created from distortions of dot patterns arranged in familiar shapes. Participants then made pairwise similarity judgements of the patterns. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses of the similar- ity data revealed the prototypes to be psychological extreme points, not central tendencies. Evidence for extreme point representations was also found for novel prototype patterns dis- playing a symmetry structure and for prototypes of grid patterns used in recent studies by McLaren and colleagues (McLaren, Bennet, Guttman-Nahir, Kim, \& Mackintosh, 1995). When used in combination with the derived MDS solutions, an exemplar-based model of cate- gorization, the Generalized Context Model (Nosofsky, 1986), provided good 􏱤 ts to the observed categorization data in all three experiments.},

In Experiment 3, responses to patterns with high between-category similarity became automatized more slowly than responses to patterns with low between-category similarity.

While many applications seek groups that are well-separated, i.e., dissimilar from each other, others require the different groups to be as similar as possible. Examples include the assignment of students to parallel courses, assembling stimulus sets in experimental psychology, splitting achievement tests into parts of equal difficulty, and dividing a data set for cross validation. We present anticlust, an easy-to-use and free software package for solving these problems fast and in an automated manner. The package anticlust is an open source extension to the R programming language and implements the methodology of anticlustering. Anticlustering divides elements into similar parts, ensuring similarity between groups by enforcing heterogeneity within groups. Thus, anticlustering is the direct reversal of cluster analysis that aims to maximize homogeneity within groups and dissimilarity between groups. Our package anticlust implements two anticlustering criteria, reversing the clustering methods k-means and cluster editing, respectively. In a simulation study, we show that anticlustering returns excellent results and outperforms alternative approaches like random assignment and matching. In three example applications, we illustrate how to apply anticlust on real data sets. We demonstrate how to assign experimental stimuli to equivalent sets based on norming data, how to divide a large data set for cross validation, and how to split a test into parts of equal item difficulty and discrimination.},

  abstract = {For causal knowledge to be worth learning, it must remain valid when that knowledge is applied. Because unknown background causes are potentially present, and may vary across the learning and application contexts, extricating the strength of a candidate cause requires an assumption regarding the decomposition of the observed outcome into the unobservable influences from the candidate and from background causes. Acquiring stable, useable causal knowledge is challenging when the search space of candidate causes is large, such that the reasoner's current set of candidates may fail to include a cause that generalizes well to an application context. We have hypothesized that an indispensable navigation device that shapes our causal representations toward useable knowledge involves the concept of causal invariance {\textendash} the sameness of how a cause operates to produce an effect across contexts. Here, we tested our causal invariance hypothesis by making use of the distinct mathematical functions expressing causal invariance for two outcome-variable types: continuous and binary. Our hypothesis predicts that, given identical prior domain knowledge, intuitive causal judgments should vary in accord with the causal-invariance function for a reasoner's perceived outcome-variable type. The judgments are made as if the reasoner aspires to formulate causally invariant knowledge. Our experiments involved two cue-competition paradigms: blocking and overexpectation. Results show that adult humans tacitly use the appropriate causal-invariance functions for decomposition. Our analysis offers an explanation for the apparent elusiveness of the blocking effect and the adaptiveness of intuitive causal inference to the representation-dependent reality in the mind.},

Differences in the actual variability of group members were reflected in subjects' estimates of variability, in their tendency to generalize from the traits and goals of a single member to the entire group, and in their classification judgments of new instances, which reflected their expectations of group members' future behavior. Memory for instances of the category also played a role in these judgment tasks. In Experiment 2, subjects who first learned about the behaviors performed by group members and then about general characteristics of the group perceived the group as more variable than did those who learned the same information in the reverse order. In both experiments, we manipulated memory for specific behaviors such that either the most extreme behaviors or behaviors at the center of the distribution were most memorable. This manipulation did not afiect estimates of perceived variability, suggesting that these were constructed and stored on-line rather than from a retrieved set of category exemplars.},

  abstract = {When a new sensorimotor mapping is learned through practice, learning commonly transfers to unpracticed regions of task space, that is, generalization ensues. Does generalization reflect fixed properties of movement representations in the nervous system and thereby limit what visuomotor mappings can and cannot be learned? Or does what needs to be learned determine the shape of generalization? We used the broad generalization properties of visuomotor gain adaptation to address these questions. Adaptation to a single gain for reaching movements is known to generalize broadly across movement directions. By training subjects on two different gains in two directions, we set up a potential conflict between generalization patterns: if generalization of gain adaptation indicates fixed properties of movement amplitude encoding, then learning two different gains in different directions should not be possible. Conversely, if generalization is flexible, then it should be possible to learn two gains. We found that subjects were able to learn two gains simultaneously, although more slowly than when they adapted to a single gain. Analysis of the resulting double-gain generalization patterns, however, unexpectedly revealed that generalization around each training direction did not arise de novo, but could be explained by a weighted combination of single-gain generalization patterns, in which the weighting takes into account the relative angular separation between training directions. Our findings therefore demonstrate that the mappings to each training target can be fully learned through reweighting of single-gain generalization patterns and not through a categorical alteration of these functions. These results are consistent with a modular decomposition approach to visuomotor adaptation, in which a complex mapping results from a combination of simpler mappings in a ``mixture-of-experts'' architecture.},

In five experiments we re-examine some of the factors which are thought to affect participant performance. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants almost always classified the test item as belonging to the high-variability category. By contrast, in Experiment 3 we employed an alternative experimental paradigm, where the difference in variability of the two categories was less salient. In that case, participants tended to classify a test item as belonging to the low-variability category. Two additional experiments (4 and 5) explored in detail the differences between Experiments 1, 2 on the one hand, and 3 on the other. Some insight into the underlying psychological processes can be provided by computational models of categorization, and we focus on the continuous version of Anderson's (1991) Rational Model, which has not been explored before in this context. The model predicts that test instances exactly halfway between the prototypes of two categories should be classified into the more variable category, consistent with the bulk of empirical findings. We also provided a comparison with a slightly reduced version of the Generalized Context Model (GCM) to show that its predictions are consistent with those from the Rational Model, for our stimulus sets.},

The current research questions concerned (a) whether such states are accessible to us and (b) whether we can act upon this information to reduce variability. For example, when playing a game of darts, there is an implicit assumption that people can wait to throw until they are in the right perceptual-attentional state. If this is true, taking away the ability to self-pace the game should worsen performance. We first tested precisely this assumption asking participants to play darts in a self-paced and a fixed-paced condition. There was no benefit of self-pacing, showing that participants were unable to use such control to improve their performance and reduce their variability. Next, we replicated these findings in 2 computer-based tasks, in which participants performed a rapid action-selection and a visual detection task in 1 self-paced and 3 forced-paced conditions. Over 4 different empirical tests, we show that the self-paced condition did not lead to improved performance or reduced variability, nor to reduced temporal dependencies in the reaction time (RT) series. Overall, it seems that, if people have any access to their fluctuating performance-relevant inner states, this access is limited and not relevant for upcoming performance.

More specifically, the structure of the variability session and its subsequent influence on transfer performance to a novel variation of the task was examined. Children tossed a weighted bean bag to a fixed target location. Three groups experienced variability in practice with four bean bags of varying weights (3,4,5, and 6 oz.); however, the trial-by-trial presentation of each weight was different for each group. One group received a random presentation of each weight from trial to trial while another experienced random presentations of a weight for blocks of three trials. The third variability group received blocked practice with six trials per blockfor each weight. All variability groups experienced the same amount of practice at each weight. A constant practice group experienced only a single weight. Following 24 practice trials, all subjects transferred outside the range of previous experience, receiving three trials with one of two possible test weights (2 oz. or 7 oz.). The results indicated that the variability group practicing with blocks of three trials at each variation led to superior performance at transfer to novel variations of the task. Overall, the experiment suggested that transfer performance for children is affected by the appropriate structure of variable practice which formulates the schemata for movement production.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Artificial language learning studies have demonstrated that learners exposed to many different nonword combinations representing a grammatical form demonstrate rapid learning of that form without explicit instruction. However, learners presented with few exemplars, even when they are repeated frequently, fail to learn the underlying grammar. This study translated this experimental finding in a therapeutic context. Method: Eighteen preschool children with language impairment received conversational recast treatment for morpheme errors. Over a 6-week period, half heard 12 unique verbs twice each during recasts (low-variability condition), and half heard 24 unique verbs (high-variability condition). Children's use of trained and untrained morphemes on generalization probes as well as spontaneous use of trained morphemes was tracked throughout treatment. Results: The high-variability condition only produced significant change in children's use of trained morphemes, but not untrained morphemes. Data from individual children confirmed that more children in the high- than the low-variability condition showed a strong treatment effect. Children in the high-variability condition also produced significantly more unique utterances containing their trained morpheme than children in the low-variability condition. Conclusion: The results support the use of highly variable input in a therapeutic context to facilitate grammatical morpheme learning.},

We sought to better understand the neural responses to the structural features of object categories that result from implicit learning. Adult participants were exposed to 32 object categories that contained three structural properties: frequency, variability, and co-occurrences, during an implicit learning task. After this exposure, participants completed a recognition task and were then presented with blocks of learned object categories during fMRI sessions. Analyses were performed by extracting data from ROIs placed throughout the fusiform gyri and lateral occipital cortex and comparing the effects of the different structural properties throughout the ROIs. Behaviorally, we found that symbol category recognition was supported by frequency, but not variability. Neurally, we found that sensitivity to object categories was greater in the right hemisphere and increased as ROIs were moved posteriorly. Frequency and variability altered the brain activation while processing object categories, although the presence of learned co-occurrences did not. Moreover, variability and co-occurrence interacted as a function of ROI, with the posterior fusiform gyrus being most sensitive to this relationship. This result suggests that variability may guide the learner to relevant co-occurrences and this is supported by the posterior ventral temporal cortex. Broadly, our results suggest that the internal features of the categories themselves are key factors in the category learning system.},

Both skill learning and priming were observed across a wide range of skill levels. Performance reflected the effects of learning at 3 different levels of stimulus structure, calling into question a binary dichotomy between item-specific priming and general skill learning. Two computational models were developed which demonstrated that previous dissociations between skill learning and priming can occur within a single memory system. The experimental and computational results are interpreted as suggesting that skill learning and priming should be viewed as 2 aspects of a single incremental learning mechanism.

As the variability among the memorized patterns increases,so does the ability of Ss to classify highly distorted new instances. These findings argue that information about the schema is abstracted from the stored instan- ces with very high efficiency. It is unclear whether the abstraction of in- formation involved in classifying the schema occurs while learning the original patterns or whether the abstraction process takes place at the time of the first presentation of the schema.},

Supposedly, this is the case because a random schedule of practice necessitates more elaborate cognitive activities than a blocked schedule before each acquisition trial can be initiated. Our main objective was to determine whether the advantage for learning found for random practice increases as a function of the number of acquisition trials. During acquisition, the results indicated a general tendency for smaller movement reproduction errors under a blocked rather than a random schedule of practice. However, this effect disappeared with larger amount of acquisition trials. In retention, larger errors were observed when acquisition occurred under a blocked rather than a random schedule of practice. Finally, the disadvantage for learning observed for the blocked schedule of practice disappeared under a block-repeated condition in which each movement pattern was first practiced under a blocked schedule which was then repeated a second time. The results are discussed in terms of the so-called contextual interference effect and indicates some of its limitations.},

We show that under the assumption of uniform observation entropy, one can build an implication model which directly predicts the outcome of the potential next observation conditioned on the results of past observations, and selects the observation with the maximum entropy. This approach enjoys reduced computation complexity by bypassing the complicated hypothesis space, and can be trained on observation data alone, learning how to query without knowledge of the hidden hypothesis.},

While many studies have taken this as evidence to support the notion of age-related deficits in cognitive processing, Ramscar, Hendrix, Shaoul, Milin, and Baayen (Topics in Cognitive Science, 6(1), 5{\textendash}42) and Ramscar, Sun, Hendrix, and Baayen (Psychological Science, 28(8), 1171{\textendash}1179, 2017) posit that the decline in performance on various cognitive tasks can be explained by the accumulation of linguistic knowledge over time. To demonstrate this, Ramscar et al. (2017) found that older bilingual participants outperformed monolingual counterparts on a verbal PAL task, proposed to be due to bilinguals having accumulated less information about the words used in the study. However, comparing bilinguals to monolinguals introduces confounding factors. For example, bilingual's better performance may be due to superior executive functioning. To minimize these between-subject confounds, the current study used a withinsubject design in order to examine the influence of linguistic experience on paired associate learning in younger and older adults. Linguistic experience was modeled using a semantic diversity measure of word strength (Jones, Johns, \& Recchia, 2012). When frequency is controlled for, high semantic diversity words are associated to a greater number of words and have a higher average strength of association. In the current study, PAL performance of older adults was significantly lower for word pairs involving high semantic diversity words, while their performance did not differ for low semantic diversity words, consistent with the information accumulation perspective of aging.},

To test this, we extract participants' priors over various contexts using a free-form forecasting paradigm. Instead of exhibiting systematic biases, our results show that participants' priors match well with structure found in real-world data. Moreover, given the same data set, structured priors induce predictably different posterior forecasts depending on the evoked situational context.},

Application of latent Markov analysis allows detection and investigation of such multiple latent category representations in a statistically robust way, isolating low performers and quantifying shifts between latent strategies. We reanalyzed data from three experiments presented in Johansen and Palmeri (2002), which comprised prolonged training of ill-defined categories, with the aim of studying the changing interactions between underlying learning systems. Our results broadly confirm the original conclusion that, in most participants, learning involved a shift from a rule-based to an exemplar-based strategy. Separate analyses of latent strategies revealed that (a) shifts from a rule-based to an exemplar-based strategy resulted in an initial decrease of speed and an increase of accuracy; (b) exemplar-based strategies followed a power law of learning, indicating automatization once an exemplar-based strategy was used; (c) rule-based strategies changed from using pure rules to rules-plus-exceptions, which appeared as a dual processes as indicated by the accuracy and response-time profiles. Results suggest an additional pathway of learning ill-defined categories, namely involving a shift from a simple rule to a complex rule after which this complex rule is automatized as an exemplar-based strategy.},

  abstract = {Many contexts in motor learning require a learner to change from an existing movement solution to a novel movement solution to perform the same task. Recent evidence has pointed to motor variability prior to learning as a potential marker for predicting individual differences in motor learning. However, it is not known if this variability is predictive of the ability to adopt a new movement solution for the same task. Here, we examined this question in the context of a redundant precision task requiring control of motor variability. Fifty young adults learned a precision task that involved throwing a virtual puck toward a target using both hands. Because the speed of the puck depended on the sum of speeds of both hands, this task could be achieved using multiple solutions. Participants initially performed a baseline task where there was no constraint on the movement solution, and then performed a novel task where they were constrained to adopt a specific movement solution requiring asymmetric left and right hand speeds. Results showed that participants were able to learn the new solution, and this change was associated with changes in both the amount and structure of variability. However, increased baseline motor variability did not facilitate initial or final task performance when using the new solution {\textendash} in fact, greater variability was associated with higher errors. These results suggest that motor variability is not necessarily indicative of flexibility and highlight the role of the task context in determining the relation between motor variability and learning. {\'O} 2021 IBRO.

In particular, variability might enhance the discriminative learning of cues, resulting in attitudes towards abstract entities rather than concrete instances. Using evaluative conditioning as an experimental paradigm to study attitude acquisition, we manipulated the variability of conditioned stimuli (CSs) that were paired with unconditioned stimuli (USs) of negative or positive valence. CSs resembled Chinese characters that could be grouped into categories by one common component. In the invariable condition, one item per category served as CSs. In the variable condition, multiple items per category were used as CSs. We measured participants' evaluations of the CSs and novel Chinese characters (generalization stimuli), and included a recognition memory task and evaluative measures of CS components. As compared to the invariable condition, the learning condition that introduced variability among CSs facilitated generalization towards novel stimuli, diminished recognition memory performance, and produced evaluative ratings of CS components that were more extreme for common components. The findings suggest the formation of attitudes towards abstract cues rather than concrete instances in the variable relative to the invariable condition, and propose that high variability facilitates the generalization of likes and dislikes. We discuss mechanistic explanations as well as practical implications with regard to the formation of prejudice and intergroup biases.},

Here, the authors explored the behaviors associated with the spatial control for manual interception. The examined task required controlling a cursor to intercept moving targets on a touch screen. They explored the effects of target motion direction, curvature and occlusion on manual interception. They observed occlusion-dependent spatial errors and arrival times for curved and diagonal trajectories (larger errors and earlier arrival of the finger at its final position with longer occlusion). These effects were particularly apparent for targets moving away from screen center at interception due to curve. In a follow-up experiment, the authors showed that the outward curve effects on spatial errors were absent because the associated trajectories appears to move toward positions that participants could expect the target to never reach. Their analyses also revealed occlusion-dependent spatial errors for diagonal trajectories, which is the well-known angle-of-approach effect. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that this effect was not due to the central initial cursor position acting as a visual reference point or the initial ocular pursuit. Most importantly, the angle-of-approach effect persisted in a judgment task. The authors thus concluded that this effect does not stem from online information-based modulations of movement speed, but from target information used to control aiming (i.e., movement direction).

  abstract = {We used two simple unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify differential trajectories of change in children who undergo intensive working memory (WM) training. We used self-organizing maps (SOMs){\textemdash}a type of simple artificial neural network{\textemdash}to represent multivariate cognitive training data, and then tested whether the way tasks are represented changed as a result of training. The patterns of change we observed in the SOM weight matrices implied that the processes drawn upon to perform WM tasks changed following training. This was then combined with K-means clustering to identify distinct groups of children who respond to the training in different ways. Firstly, the K-means clustering was applied to an independent large sample (N = 616, Mage = 9.16 years, range = 5.16{\textendash}17.91 years) to identify subgroups. We then allocated children who had been through cognitive training (N = 179, Mage = 9.00 years, range = 7.08{\textendash}11.50 years) to these same four subgroups, both before and after their training. In doing so, we were able to map their improvement trajectories. Scores on a separate measure of fluid intelligence were predictive of a child's improvement trajectory. This paper provides an alternative approach to analysing cognitive training data that go beyond considering changes in individual tasks. This proof-of-principle demonstrates a potentially powerful way of distinguishing task-specific from domain-general changes following training and of establishing different profiles of response to training.},

  abstract = {Extended practice on a particular cognitive task can boost the performance of other tasks, even though they themselves have not been practised. This transfer of benefits appears to be specific, occurring most when tasks are very similar to those being trained. But what type of similarity is most important for predicting transfer? This question is addressed with a tightly controlled randomised design, with a relatively large sample (N = 175) and an adaptive control group. We created a hierarchical set of nested assessment tasks. Participants then trained on two of the tasks: one was relatively ?low? in the hierarchy requiring just simultaneous judgements of shapes? spikiness, whereas the other was relatively ?high? requiring delayed judgements of shapes? spikiness or number of spikes in a switching paradigm. Using the full complement of nested tasks before and after training, we could then test whether and how these ?low? and ?high? training effects cascade through the hierarchy. For both training groups, relative to the control, whether or not an assessment task shared a single specific feature was the best predictor of transfer patterns. For the low-level training group, the overall proportion of feature overlap also significantly predicted transfer, but the same was not true for the high-level training group. Finally, pre-training between-task correlations were not predictive of the pattern of transfer for either group. Together these findings provide an experimental exploration of the specificity of transfer and establish the nature of task overlap that is crucial for the transfer of performance improvements.},

Examining how subsequent reaches in unpracticed directions generalize reveals this representation. Although often studied, it is not known how this representation changes across training directions, or how changes in reach direction and the corresponding changes in limb impedance, influence these measurements. We ran a force field adaptation experiment using eight groups of subjects each trained on one of eight standard directions and then tested for generalization in the remaining seven directions. Generalization in all directions was local and asymmetric, providing limited and unequal transfer to the left and right side of the trained target. These asymmetries were not consistent in either magnitude or direction, even after correcting for changes in limb impedance. Relying on a standard model for generalization the inferred representations inconsistently shifted to one side or the other of their respective training direction. A second model that accounted for limb impedance and variations in baseline trajectories explained more data and the inferred representations were centered on their respective training directions. Our results highlight the influence of limb mechanics and impedance on psychophysical measurements and their interpretations for motor learning.},

Participants learned name and face associations for unfamiliar identities presented in high or low within-person variability?that is, images of the same person returned by internet search on their name (high variability) versus different images of the same person taken from the same event (low variability). In Experiment 1 we show more accurate performance on a speeded name verification task for identities learned in high than in low variability, when the test images are completely novel photos. In Experiment 2 we show more accurate performance on a face matching task for identities previously learned in high than in low variability. The results show that exposure to a large range of within-person variability leads to enhanced learning of new identities.},

Thirty participants (22 F; 18{\textendash}32 years old) completed two unidimensional rule-based category learning tasks in a single day {\textendash} one with auditory stimuli and another with visual stimuli. We replicated the results in a second experiment with a larger online sample (N = 99, 45 F, 18{\textendash}35 years old). The categories were identically structured in the two modalities to facilitate comparison. We compared categorization accuracy, decision processes as assessed through drift-diffusion models, and the generalizability of resulting category representation through a generalization test. We found that individuals learned auditory and visual categories to similar extents and that accuracies were highly correlated across the two tasks. Participants had similar evidence accumulation rates in later learning, but early on had slower rates for visual than auditory learning. Participants also demonstrated differences in the decision thresholds across modalities. Participants had more categorical generalizable representations for visual than auditory categories. These results suggest that some modality-general cognitive processes support category learning but also suggest that the modality of the stimuli may also affect category learning behavior and outcomes.},

There is great theoretical and practical value in building theories that can be used to explain or to predict variations in cognitive control as a function of experimental manipulations or individual differences. A critical step toward building such theories is determining which latent constructs are shared between laboratory tasks that are designed to measure cognitive control. In the current work, we examine this question in a novel way by formally linking computational models of two canonical cognitive control tasks, the Eriksen flanker and task-switching task. Specifically, we examine whether model parameters that capture cognitive control processes in one task can be swapped across models to make predictions about individual differences in performance on another task. We apply our modeling and analysis to a large scale data set from an online cognitive training platform, which optimizes our ability to detect individual differences in the data. Our results suggest that the flanker and task-switching tasks probe common control processes. This finding supports the view that higher level cognitive control processes as opposed to solely strategies in speed and accuracy tradeoffs, or perceptual processing and motor response speed are shared across the two tasks. We discuss how our computational modeling substitution approach addresses limitations of prior efforts to relate performance across different cognitive control tasks, and how our findings inform current theories of cognitive control.

  abstract = {In this pr{\'e}cis of our recent book, Semantic Cognition: A Parallel Distributed Processing Approach (Rogers \& McClelland 2004), we present a parallel distributed processing theory of the acquisition, representation, and use of human semantic knowledge. The theory proposes that semantic abilities arise from the flow of activation among simple, neuron-like processing units, as governed by the strengths of interconnecting weights; and that acquisition of new semantic information involves the gradual adjustment of weights in the system in response to experience. These simple ideas explain a wide range of empirical phenomena from studies of categorization, lexical acquisition, and disordered semantic cognition. In this pr{\'e}cis we focus on phenomena central to the reaction against similarity-based theories that arose in the 1980s and that subsequently motivated the ``theory-theory'' approach to semantic knowledge. Specifically, we consider (1) how concepts differentiate in early development, (2) why some groupings of items seem to form ``good'' or coherent categories while others do not, (3) why different properties seem central or important to different concepts, (4) why children and adults sometimes attest to beliefs that seem to contradict their direct experience, (5) how concepts reorganize between the ages of 4 and 10, and (6) the relationship between causal knowledge and semantic knowledge. The explanations our theory offers for these phenomena are illustrated with reference to a simple feed-forward connectionist model. The relationships between this simple model, the broader theory, and more general issues in cognitive science are discussed.},

Using the simple and easily measured paradigm of visual-motor rearrangement created by the use of visual displacement lenses, we sought to determine whether an individual's ability to adapt to visuo-motor discordance could be improved through training. Subjects threw small balls at a stationary target during a 3-week practice regimen involving repeated exposure to one set of lenses in block practice ({\texttimes}2.0 magnifying lenses), multiple sets of lenses in variable practice ({\texttimes}2.0 magnifying, {\texttimes}0.5 minifying and up{\textendash}down reversing lenses) or sham lenses. At the end of training, adaptation to a novel visuo-motor situation (20-degree right shift lenses) was tested. We found that (1) training with variable practice can increase adaptability to a novel visuo-motor situation, (2) increased adaptability is retained for at least 1 month and is transferable to further novel visuo-motor permutations and (3) variable practice improves performance of a simple motor task even in the undisturbed state. These results have implications for the design of clinical rehabilitation programs and countermeasures to enhance astronaut adaptability, facilitating adaptive transitions between gravitational environments.},

Experiments 1 and 2 together also established a novel dissociation between RB and II category learning: increasing variability on irrelevant stimulus dimensions impaired II learning but not RB learning.

One domain where links between cognition and action have been explored is the manipulation of objects. This article reviews psychological research on this topic, with special emphasis on the tendency to grasp objects differently depending on what one plans to do with the objects. Such differential grasping has been demonstrated in a wide range of object manipulation tasks, including grasping an object in a way that reveals anticipation of the object's future orientation, height, and required placement precision. Differential grasping has also been demonstrated in a wide range of behaviors, including one-hand grasps, two-hand grasps, walking, and transferring objects from place to place as well as from person to person. The populations in whom the tendency has been shown are also diverse, including nonhuman primates as well as human adults, children, and babies. Meanwhile, the tendency is compromised in a variety of clinical populations and in children of a surprisingly advanced age. Verbal working memory is compromised as well if words are memorized while object manipulation tasks are performed; the recency portion of the serial position curve is reduced in this circumstance. In general, the research reviewed here points to rich connections between cognition and action as revealed through the study of object manipulation. Other implications concern affordances, Donders' Law, and naturalistic observation and the teaching of psychology.},

The central idea is that when a spatial target is selected as an object to be reached, stored postures are evaluated for the contributions they can make to the task. Weights are assigned to the stored postures, and a single target posture is found by taking a weighted sum of the stored postures. Movement is achieved by reducing the distance between the starting angle and target angle of each joint. The model explains compensation for reduced joint mobility, tool use, practice effects, performance errors, and aspects of movement kinematics. Extensions of the model can account for anticipation and coarticulation effects, movement through via points, and hierarchical control of series of movements.},

We study S\textsubscript{n} and Q\textsubscript{n} by means of their influence functions, their bias curves (for implosion as well as explosion), and their finite-sample performance.

In this review, we consider the influence of (a) the perceiver's group affiliation, (b) the group's objective variability, (c) the group's social position, and (d) the group's central tendency on trait dimensions.

We found that graphs with a logarithmic, as opposed to a linear, scale resulted in laypeople making less accurate predictions of how fast cases would increase, viewing COVID-19 as less dangerous, and expressing both less support for policy interventions and less intention to take personal actions to combat the disease. Education about the differences between linear and logarithmic graphs reduces but does not eliminate these effects. These results suggest that communications to the general public should mostly use linear graphs. When logarithmic graphs must be used, they should be presented alongside linear graphs of the same data and with guidance on how to interpret the plots.},

However, little is known about which aspects of task variability are important for optimizing training outcomes. This study systematically examined the impact of variability in the different task components on outcome measures, here manipulating content (whether the task stimuli remained fixed or changed between blocks) and the deeper structural task configuration (task sequence: whether the task sequence was fixed or random). Short-term task switching training was implemented with one of four training variability conditions: fixed content{\textbackslash}fixed structure; fixed content{\textbackslash} random structure; varied content{\textbackslash}fixed structure and varied content{\textbackslash}varied structure. The experiment consisted of a baseline block, seven training blocks (learning phase), followed by two transfer blocks, one with fixed and one with random task structure, respectively. In the learning phase, more rapid training gains were observed in the fixed content as compared to varied content. Interestingly, training with fixed content resulted in a trend for costs when transferred to a novel task switching context. In contrast, moderate transfer gains were noted in the varied content condition, manifested specifically on switch trials. These results suggest that task (content) variability is one of the means to improve positive transfer and avoid negative transfer. Additionally, and in agreement with the wide literature on training, this finding suggests that conditions that prevent training gains are in fact beneficial for learning generalization.},

The current study asked how general the effects of perceptual aptitude are by testing whether they occur with training materials spoken by native speakers and whether they depend on the nature of the to-be-learned material. Forty-five native Dutch listeners took part in a 5-day training procedure in which they identified bisyllabic Mandarin pseudowords (e.g., asa) pronounced with different lexical tone combinations. The training materials were presented to different groups of listeners at three levels of variability: low (many repetitions of a limited set of words recorded by a single speaker), medium (fewer repetitions of a more variable set of words recorded by three speakers), and high (similar to medium but with five speakers). Overall, variability did not influence learning performance, but this was due to an interaction with individuals' perceptual aptitude: increasing variability hindered improvements in performance for low-aptitude perceivers while it helped improvements in performance for high-aptitude perceivers. These results show that the previously observed interaction between individuals' aptitude and effects of degree of variability extends to natural tokens of Mandarin speech. This interaction was not found, however, in a closely matched study in which native Dutch listeners were trained on the Japanese geminate/singleton consonant contrast. This may indicate that the effectiveness of high-variability training depends not only on individuals' aptitude in speech perception but also on the nature of the categories being acquired.},

  abstract = {During visually guided grasping movements, visual information is transformed into motor commands. This transformation is known as the ``visuomotor map.'' To investigate limitations in the short-term plasticity of the visuomotor map in normal humans, we studied the maximum grip aperture (MGA) during the reaching phase while subjects grasped objects of various sizes. The objects seen and the objects grasped were physically never the same. When a discrepancy had been introduced between the size of the visual and the grasped objects, and the subjects were fully adapted to it, they all readily interpolated and extrapolated the MGA to objects not included in training trials. In contrast, when the subjects were exposed to discrepancies that required a slope change in the visuomotor map, they were unable to adapt adequately. They instead retained a subject-specific slope of the relationship between the visual size and MGA. We conclude from these results that during reaching for grasping, normal subjects are unable to abandon a straight linear function determining the relationship between visual object size and MGA. Moreover, the plasticity of the visuomotor map is, at least in short term, constrained to allow only offset changes, that is, only ``rigid shifts'' are possible between the visual and motor coordinate systems.},

Here we argue, however, that even though accurate extrapolation necessitates rule-learning, the reverse does not necessarily hold: Inaccurate extrapolation does not exclude rule-learning. Experiment 1 shows that more than one third of participants who would be classified as ``exemplar-based learners'' based on their extrapolation accuracy were able to identify the correct function shape and slope in a rule-selection paradigm, demonstrating accurate understanding of the function rule. Experiment 2 shows that higher proportions of rule learning than ruleapplication in the function-learning paradigm is not due to (i) higher a priori probabilities to guess the correct rule in the rule-selection paradigm; nor is it due to (ii) a lack of simultaneous access to all function values in the function-learning paradigm. We conclude that rule application is not tantamount to rule-learning, and that assessing rule xlearning via extrapolation accuracy underestimates the proportion of rule learners in function-learning experiments.},

This finding cannot be predicted by exemplar models when all exemplars share the same attention along a dimension. With dimension-wide attention, violating and rule-following items are treated equally. When each exemplar selects which dimensions to attend to, exemplar models can predict the memory advantage for violating items. With exemplar-specific attention, attention is distributed uniformly for exemplars encoding violating items but is allocated to the rule dimension of exemplars encoding rulefollowing items. This differential attention makes violating items distinctive in memory. In addition to exemplar-specific attention, exemplar models need the ability to distinguish important errors from negligible ones to predict better memory for items that violate a stronger than a weaker rule.},

In this light, theories and models of category learning can be viewed as accounts of how people capture and represent meaningful variation. Similarity-based models, such as prototype and exemplar models, cannot correctly predict that humans classify a stimulus halfway between the nearest members of a low-variability and high-variability category into the high-variability category. Distributional accounts, descending from the unequal variance signal detection model, can accommodate the result. We present a simple extension to similarity-based models that allows them to display the sensitivity to category variability that humans display. We conclude by discussing what constitutes similarity-based representations and processes and noting the points of convergence between similarity-based and distributional approaches.},

Here, we propose a novel integration in which MDS representations are used to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically derive psychological representations for unlimited numbers of natural stimuli. In an example application, we train an ensemble of CNNs to produce the MDS coordinates of images of rocks, and we show that the ensemble can predict the MDS coordinates of new sets of rocks, even those not part of the original MDS space. We then show that the CNN-predicted MDS representations, unlike offthe-shelf CNN representations, can be used in conjunction with a formal psychological model to predict human categorization behavior. We further show that the CNNs can be trained to produce additional dimensions that extend the original MDS space and provide even better model fits to human category-learning data. Our integrated method provides a promising approach that can be instrumental in allowing researchers to extend traditional psychological-scaling and category-learning models to the complex, high-dimensional domains that exist in the natural world.},

In contrast to other approaches, the size and shape of the receptive field of each locally linear model, as well as the parameters of the locally linear model itself, are learned independently, that is, without the need for competition or any other kind of communication. Independent learning is accomplished by incrementally minimizing a weighted local cross-validation error. As a result, we obtain a learning system that can allocate resources as needed while dealing with the bias-variance dilemma in a principled way. The spatial localization of the linear models increases robustness toward negative interference. Our learning system can be interpreted as a nonparametric adaptive bandwidth smoother, as a mixture of experts where the experts are trained in isolation, and as a learning system that profits from combining independent expert knowledge on the same problem. This article illustrates the potential learning capabilities of purely local learning and offers an interesting and powerful approach to learning with receptive fields.},

This theoretical framework of a cognitive toolbox provides a plausible account of intra- and interindividual differences in human behavior. Unfortunately, it is often unclear how to rigorously test the toolbox framework. How can a toolbox model be quantitatively specified? How can the number of toolbox strategies be limited to prevent uncontrolled strategy sprawl? How can a toolbox model be formally tested against alternative theories? The authors show how these challenges can be met by using Bayesian inference techniques. By means of parameter recovery simulations and the analysis of empirical data across a variety of domains (i.e., judgment and decision making, children's cognitive development, function learning, and perceptual categorization), the authors illustrate how Bayesian inference techniques allow toolbox models to be quantitatively specified, strategy sprawl to be contained, and toolbox models to be rigorously tested against competing theories. The authors demonstrate that their approach applies at the individual level but can also be generalized to the group level with hierarchical Bayesian procedures. The suggested Bayesian inference techniques represent a theoretical and methodological advancement for toolbox theories of cognition and behavior.},

The effect of stimulus diversity was assessed by controlling and manipulating the number of exposures to a given set and the number of unique strings presented to the learner during the training phase. 147 students participated in two studies. In the unvaried stimulus study, 71 participants learned the same basic set of 15 exemplars, once(15~{\texttimes}~1 exposure), twice (15~{\texttimes}~2 exposures~=~30 total strings) and 3 times (15~{\texttimes}~3 exposures~=~45 total strings). In the varied stimulus study, 75 participants learned 15, 30 and 45, all of which were unique, unrepeated exemplars. All groups were asked to classify test strings for their grammaticality following training. Results of the d' measures in the unvaried stimulus study indicate similar performance across the groups. Conversely, the results of the varied stimulus study show that the group presented with 45 unique strings performed significantly better than the baseline group (15 strings). Analysis of the differences across the equivalent groups in the two studies (15~{\texttimes}~2 exposures vs. 30 unique strings and 15~{\texttimes}~3 exposures vs. 45 unique strings) indicates differences in performance only between the group who was presented with the same 15 strings three times and the group presented with 45 unrepeated strings.

The key novelty of the model is its explanation of how rules are learned from scratch based on three central assumptions.

Additionally, CAL's three free parameters, which measure abstraction, memorization and attention control, are related to abilities measured in working memory tasks in a theoretically meaningful way. We illustrate the model's explanatory scope by simulating several phenomena (peak shift, sample size, instruction effects, extrapolation), which were so far unexplained (or unexplained within a single model).

The congruency effect is the observation that response times and errors are increased when the word and colour are incongruent (e.g., the word ``red'' in green ink) relative to when they are congruent (e.g., ``red'' in red). The proportion congruent effect is the finding that congruency effects are reduced when trials are mostly incongruent rather than mostly congruent. This proportion congruent effect can be context-specific. For instance, if trials are mostly incongruent when presented in one location and mostly congruent when presented in another location, the congruency effect is smaller for the former location. Typically, proportion congruent effects are interpreted in terms of strategic control of attention in response to conflict, termed conflict adaptation or conflict monitoring. In the present manuscript, however, an episodic learning account is presented for context-specific proportion congruent effects. In particular, it is argued that context-specific contingency learning can explain part of the effect, and context-specific rhythmic responding can explain the rest. Both contingency-based and temporal-based learning can parsimoniously be conceptualized within an episodic learning framework. An adaptation of the Parallel Episodic Processing (PEP) model is presented. This model successfully simulates context-specific proportion congruent effects, both for contingency-biased and contingency-unbiased (transfer) items. The same fixed-parameter model can explain a range of other findings from the learning, timing, binding, practice, and attentional control domains.},

The extended PEP model is then used to simulate a number of key findings from the task switching domain. These include the switch cost, task-rule congruency effects, response repetition asymmetries, cue repetition benefits, and the full pattern of means from a recent feature integration decomposition of cued task switching (). We demonstrate that the PEP model fits the participant data well, that the model does not possess the flexibility to match any pattern of results, and that a number of competing task switching models fail to account for key observations that the PEP model produces naturally. Given the parsimony and unique explanatory power of the episodic account presented here, our results suggest that feature-integration biases have a far greater power in explaining task-switching performance than previously assumed.},

The results demonstrate several important points. First, the same retrieval mechanism parsimoniously explains stimulus-response binding, contingency learning, and practice effects. Second, as performance improves with practice, any effects will shrink with it. Third, a model of simple learning processes is sufficient to explain phenomena that are typically (but perhaps incorrectly) interpreted in terms of higher-order control processes. More generally, we argue that computational models with a fixed parameter set and wider breadth should be preferred over those that are restricted to a narrow set of phenomena. {\'O} 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Subjects repeated and then followed the instructions by mouse clicking on the grid. They were trained, given a short distractor task, and then tested. There were three groups, each receiving different message lengths during training: easy (short lengths), hard (long lengths), and mixed (all lengths), with all subjects given all lengths at test. At test, the mixed group was best on most lengths, the easy group was better than the hard group on short lengths, and the hard group was better than the easy group on long lengths. The results support the advantages of both specificity and variability of training but do not support the hypothesis that difficult training of the form used here would lead to overall best performance at test.},

  abstract = {Skill training aims to improve the performance of the task at hand and aims to transfer the acquired skill to related tasks. Both skill training and skill transfer are part of our everyday lives, and essential for survival, and their importance is reflected in years of research. Despite these enormous efforts, however, the complex relationship between skill training and skill transfer is not yet portrayed completely. Building upon two theories, we probed this relationship through the example of bimanual learning with a large cross-sectional design (N = 450) using an online framework. We designed five training tasks which differed in the variance of the training material (schema theory) and three transfer tasks differing in their similarity to the training task (identical elements theory). Theoretically, the five training tasks and the three transfer tasks varied approximately linearly from each other. Empirical data, however, suggested merely the presence of three statistically different training tasks and two significantly different transfer tasks, indicating a nonlinear relationship. Against our expectation, Bayesian statistics suggested that the type of skill training was not related to the type of skill transfer. However, the amount of skill training was positively related to the amount of skill transfer. Together, we showed that motor learning studies can be conducted online. Further, our results shed light on the complex relationship between skill training and skill transfer. Understanding this relationship has wide-ranging practical implications for the general population, particularly for musicians, athletes and patients recovering from injury.},

A model for motor learning is presented combining simulated annealing and stochastic resonance phenomena against the background of different time scales for adaptation and learning processes.

We investigate this question by letting participants play a communication game, where one player describes a pattern, and another player redraws it based on the description alone. We use this paradigm to compare two models of pattern description, one compositional (complex structures built out of simpler ones) and one noncompositional. We find that compositional patterns are communicated more effectively than noncompositional patterns, that a compositional model of pattern description predicts which patterns are harder to describe, and that this model can be used to evaluate participants' drawings, producing humanlike quality ratings. Our results suggest that natural language can tap into a compositionally structured pattern description language.},

  abstract = {We introduce the contextual multi-armed bandit task as a framework to investigate learning and decision making in uncertain environments. In this novel paradigm, participants repeatedly choose between multiple options in order to maximise their rewards. The options are described by a number of contextual features which are predictive of the rewards through initially unknown functions. From their experience with choosing options and observing the consequences of their decisions, participants can learn about the functional relation between contexts and rewards and improve their decision strategy over time. In three experiments, we explore participants' behaviour in such learning environments. We predict participants' behaviour by context-blind (mean-tracking, Kalman filter) and contextual (Gaussian process and linear regression) learning approaches combined with different choice strategies. Participants are mostly able to learn about the context-reward functions and their behaviour is best described by a Gaussian process learning strategy which generalizes previous experience to similar instances. In a relatively simple task with binary features, they seem to combine this learning with a ``probability of improvement'' decision strategy which focuses on alternatives that are expected to lead to an improvement upon a current favourite option. In a task with continuous features that are linearly related to the rewards, participants seem to more explicitly balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, in a difficult learning environment where the relation between features and rewards is non-linear, some participants are again well-described by a Gaussian process learning strategy, whereas others revert to context-blind strategies.},

We will introduce Gaussian processes which generate distributions over functions used for Bayesian non-parametric regression, and demonstrate their use in applications and didactic examples including simple regression problems, a demonstration of kernel-encoded prior assumptions and compositions, a pure exploration scenario within an optimal design framework, and a bandit-like exploration{\textendash}exploitation scenario where the goal is to recommend movies. Beyond that, we describe a situation modelling risk-averse exploration in which an additional constraint (not to sample below a certain threshold) needs to be accounted for.

  abstract = {How do humans generalize from observed to unobserved data? How does generalization support inference, prediction, and decision making? I propose that a big part of human generalization can be explained by a powerful mechanism of function learning. I put forward and assess Gaussian Process regression as a model of human function learning that can unify several psychological theories of generalization. Across 14 experiments and using extensive computational modeling, I show that this model generates testable predictions about human preferences over different levels of complexity, provides a window into compositional inductive biases, and {\textendash}combined with an optimistic yet efficient sampling strategy{\textendash} guides human decision making through complex spaces. Chapters 1 and 2 propose that, from a psychological and mathematical perspective, function learning and generalization are close kin. Chapter 3 derives and tests theoretical predictionsof participants' preferences over differently complex functions. Chapter 4 develops a compositional theory of generalization and extensively probes this theory using 8 experimental paradigms.During the second half of the thesis, I investigate how function learning guides decision making in complex decision making tasks. In particular, Chapter 5 will look at how people search for rewards in various grid worlds where a spatial correlation of rewards provides a context supporting generalization and decision making. Chapter 6 gauges human behavior in contextual multi-armed bandit problems where a function maps features onto expectedrewards. In both Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, I find that the vast majority of subjects are best predicted by a Gaussian Process function learning model combined with an upper confidence bound sampling strategy. Chapter 7 will formally assess the adaptiveness of human generalization in complex decision making tasks using mismatched Bayesian optimization simulations and finds that the empirically observed phenomenon of undergeneralization might rather be a feature than a bug of human behavior.

Here, we introduce an alternative framework, called a task file, that includes hierarchical associations between stimulus features, response features, goals, and drives, which may overcome the limitations inherent in the conceptualization of response selection as being based solely on associations between stimuli and responses. We then review evidence from our own experimental research showing that even in the context of performing relatively easy tasks, the stimulus-response-association approach to response selection is inadequate to account for the interactions between discrete responses. Instead, response selection may emerge from competition between linked representations at multiple levels.},

  abstract = {While previous studies have shown that human behavior adjusts in response to uncertainty, it is still not well understood how uncertainty is estimated and represented. As probability distributions are high dimensional objects, only constrained families of distributions with a low number of parameters can be specified from finite data. However, it is unknown what the structural assumptions are that the brain uses to estimate them. We introduce a novel paradigm that requires human participants of either sex to explicitly estimate the dispersion of a distribution over future observations. Judgments are based on a very small sample from a centered, normally distributed random variable that was suggested by the framing of the task. This probability density estimation task could optimally be solved by inferring the dispersion parameter of a normal distribution. We find that although behavior closely tracks uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis and resists an explanation with simple heuristics, it is hardly consistent with parametric inference of a normal distribution. Despite the transparency of the simple generating process, participants estimate a distribution biased towards the observed instances while still strongly generalizing beyond the sample. The inferred internal distributions can be well approximated by a nonparametric mixture of spatially extended basis distributions. Thus, our results suggest that fluctuations have an excessive effect on human uncertainty judgments because of representations that can adapt overly flexibly to the sample. This might be of greater utility in more general conditions in structurally uncertain environments.},

Here, we take a comprehensive approach by studying the contributions of both perceptual experience and social-conceptual information to face learning within the same experimental design. The effect of perceptual experience was examined by systematically varying the similarity between the learned and test face views. Social information was manipulated by asking participants to make social, perceptual, or no evaluations on faces during learning. Results show better recognition for the learned views, which declines as a function of the dissimilarity between the learned and unlearned views. Additionally, processing faces as social concepts produced a general gain in performance of a similar magnitude for both the learned and unlearned views. We concluded that both social-conceptual and perceptual information contribute to face recognition but through complementary, independent mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of considering both cognition and perception to obtain comprehensive understanding of face recognition.},

  abstract = {The human ability to use different tools demonstrates our capability of forming and maintaining multiple, context-specific motor memories. Experimentally, this has been investigated in dual adaptation, where participants adjust their reaching movements to opposing visuomotor transformations. Adaptation in these paradigms occurs by distinct processes, such as strategies for each transformation or the implicit acquisition of distinct visuomotor mappings. Although distinct, transformation-dependent aftereffects have been interpreted as support for the latter, they could reflect adaptation of a single visuomotor map, which is locally adjusted in different regions of the workspace. Indeed, recent studies suggest that explicit aiming strategies direct where in the workspace implicit adaptation occurs, thus potentially serving as a cue to enable dual adaptation. Disentangling these possibilities is critical to understanding how humans acquire and maintain motor memories for different skills and tools. We therefore investigated generalization of explicit and implicit adaptation to untrained movement directions after participants practiced two opposing cursor rotations, which were associated with the visual display being presented in the left or right half of the screen. Whereas participants learned to compensate for opposing rotations by explicit strategies specific to this visual workspace cue, aftereffects were not cue sensitive. Instead, aftereffects displayed bimodal generalization patterns that appeared to reflect locally limited learning of both transformations. By varying target arrangements and instructions, we show that these patterns are consistent with implicit adaptation that generalizes locally around movement plans associated with opposing visuomotor transformations. Our findings show that strategies can shape implicit adaptation in a complex manner.             NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Visuomotor dual adaptation experiments have identified contextual cues that enable learning of separate visuomotor mappings, but the underlying representations of learning are unclear. We report that visual workspace separation as a contextual cue enables the compensation of opposing cursor rotations by a combination of explicit and implicit processes: Learners developed context-dependent explicit aiming strategies, whereas an implicit visuomotor map represented dual adaptation independent from arbitrary context cues by local adaptation around the explicit movement plan.},

Based on this model, it is possible to define a similarity measure between two tasks in order to quantify skill generalisation during the learning of simple motor tasks by humans. By fully exploring this similarity measure, a sequence of tasks capable of improving the learning efficiency for both healthy subjects and patients with motor impairment may be generated. A validation protocol is introduced and preliminary experimental results with six subjects are presented to validate the learning model and the similarity measure. Results show that the human learning of trajectory tracking tasks can accurately be modelled by an exponential decay of the average tracking error. The model fits well when the task is new or far away from a previously learnt task. Model parameters are used to analyse the learning performances of the subjects and the influence of previous tasks learning. Finally, it is shown that the similarity index can be constructed based on the proposed model to reflect skill generalisation.},

One approach to this has been the use of function learning paradigms, which allow peoples' empirical patterns of generalization for smooth scalar functions to be described precisely. However, to date, such work has not succeeded in identifying mechanisms that acquire the kinds of general purpose representations over which function learning can operate to exhibit the patterns of generalization observed in human empirical studies. Here, we present a framework for how a learner may acquire such representations, that then support generalization -- and extrapolation in particular -- in a few-shot fashion. Taking inspiration from a classic theory of visual processing, we construct a self-supervised encoder that implements the basic inductive bias of invariance under topological distortions. We show the resulting representations outperform those from other models for unsupervised time series learning in several downstream function learning tasks, including extrapolation.},

Contextual diversity measures modify word frequency by ignoring word repetition in context, while semantic diversity measures consider the semantic consistency of contextual word occurrence. Recent research has shown that a better account of lexical organization data is provided by socially based measures of semantic diversity, which encode the communication patterns of individuals across discourses (Johns, 2021b). While most research on contextual diversity has focused on single words, recent corpus-based and experimental evidence suggests that an integral part of language use involves recurrent and more structurally complex units, such as multiword phrases and idioms. The aim of the present work was to determine if contextual and semantic diversity drive lexical organization at the level of multiword units (here, operationalized as idiomatic expressions), in addition to single words. To this end, we analyzed normative ratings of familiarity for 210 English idioms (Libben \& Titone, 2008) using a set of contextual, semantic, and socially based diversity measures that were computed from a 55-billion word corpus of Reddit comments. The results confirm the superiority of diversity measures over frequency for multiword expressions, suggesting that multiword units, such as idiomatic phrases, show similar lexical organization dynamics as single words.

ML's primary concern is maximizing prediction accuracy; cognitive science's primary concern is explaining the underlying mechanisms. Cross-talk between these disciplines is limited, likely because the tasks and goals usually differ. The domain of e-learning and knowledge acquisition constitutes a fruitful intersection for the two fields' methodologies to be integrated because accurately tracking learning and forgetting over time and predicting future performance based on learning histories are central to developing effective, personalized learning tools. Here, we show how a state-of-the-art ML model can be enhanced by incorporating insights from a cognitive model of human memory. This was done by exploiting the predictive performance equation's (PPE) narrow but highly specialized domain knowledge with regard to the temporal dynamics of learning and forgetting. Specifically, the PPE was used to engineer timing-related input features for a gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT) model. The resulting PPE-enhanced GBDT outperformed the default GBDT, especially under conditions in which limited data were available for training. Results suggest that integrating cognitive and ML models could be particularly productive if the available data are too high-dimensional to be explained by a cognitive model but not sufficiently large to effectively train a modern ML algorithm. Here, the cognitive model's insights pertaining to only one aspect of the data were enough to jump-start the ML model's ability to make predictions{\textemdash}a finding that holds promise for future explorations.},

Many studies of memory and sensorimotor adaptation have proposed theories that incorporate a decay on prior events, which leads the agent to eventually forget old experiences. This study investigates if a similar decay mechanism can account for human adaptation in complex skills that require the simultaneous integration of cognitive, motor, and perceptual processes. In 2 experiments, subjects learned to play a novel racing video game while adapting to parametric changes in the physics of the game's controls. Human learning and performance were modeled using the ACT{\textendash}R cognitive architecture, which has been used successfully to model learning and fluency across a wide range of skills in prior research. Anderson et al. (2019) introduced the Controller module, a new component of the architecture that learns the setting of control parameters for actions and allows the agent to execute the rapid and precise actions that are necessary for good performance on complex tasks. Model simulations support including a moderate time{\textendash}based decay on the weight of the experiences that the Controller uses. This is implemented in the Controller module by discounting the influence of older observations which helps the agent to focus on recent experiences that better reflect the current relationship between different settings of a control parameter and the rate of payoff from using that setting.

In the current work, we compare observed data and an ACT-R model of complex skill acquisition on a navigational video game task (Space Track). Participants trained either on one or two levels of thrust. Performance on a transfer test was better in the varied training conditions in both humans and model. Performance in both humans and model was also differentially influenced by the most recently practiced thrust level. Further analyses revealed large differences between model and human behavior on more detailed measures, which suggests that that the model achieves the same overall performance through different strategies.

To date, relatively little work has examined how changes in RT relate to changes in response accuracy, and whether these changes can be accounted for quantitatively within a single theoretical framework. The current work examines joint changes in accuracy and RT in a probabilistic category learning task. We report a model-based analysis of changes in the shapes of RT distributions for different category responses at the level of individual stimuli over the course of learning. We show that changes in performance are determined solely by changes in the quality of information entering the decision process. We then develop a new model that combines an associative learning front end with a sequential sampling model of the decision process, showing that the model provides a good account of all aspects of the learning data. We conclude by discussing potential extensions of the model and future directions for theoretical development that are opened up by our findings.},

Two types of knowledge restructuring are supported by existing category learning models. The first is a relearning process, which involves incremental updating of knowledge as learning progresses. The second is a recoordination process, which involves novel changes in the way existing knowledge is applied to the task. Whereas relearning is supported by both single- and multiple-module models of category learning, only multiple-module models support recoordination. To date, only relearning has been directly supported empirically. We report two category learning experiments that provide direct evidence of recoordination. People can fluidly alternate between different categorization strategies, and moreover, can reinstate an old strategy even after prolonged use of an alternative. The knowledge restructuring data are not well fit by a single-module model (ALCOVE). By contrast, a multiple-module model (ATRIUM) quantitatively accounts for recoordination. Low-level changes in the distribution of dimensional attention are shown to subsequently affect how ATRIUM coordinates its modular knowledge. We argue that learning about complex tasks occurs at the level of the partial knowledge elements used to generate a response strategy.},

This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task  The recovery of performance within the changed me- chanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to inves- tigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we con- sidered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftefef- fects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the ner- vous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer be- yond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between vis- ited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor},

The results of Experiment 1 extended previous findings: The learning of the relative-timing pattern was systematically enhanced by the degree to which the practice conditions promoted movement consistency (constant {$>$} blocked {$>$} serial {$>$} random). Experiment 2 provided evidence that the dincrepancy between the relative-timing effects in the 2 groups of studies was a product of the way in which relative-timing goals and fcedback were presented. When the feedback was presented as segincnt times, random practice resulted in generally more stable relative-timing patterns during acquisition than blocked practice did. Thus, in both experiments, the learning of the relative-timing pattern was enhanced by more stable relative-timing conditions durin acquisition. Absolute-timing learning, as indexed by the transi,fer tests, was enhanced by serial or random practice as compared, with constant or blocked practice, and was relatively unaffected by feedback conditions directed at the relative-timing pattern. :In terms of motor programming theory, those findings are taken as additional evidence for the disassociation of memories supporting generalized motor program (GMP) performance, as indexed by relative timing, and parameter performance, as indexed by ahvolute timing.},

Participants made continuous rapid reversal movements with a lever in the horizontal plane. Groups attempted to reach a short (20{$^\circ$}) target and a long target (either 45{$^\circ$} or 70{$^\circ$}) in separate constant-practice conditions, but alternated between the two targets in a variable practice condition. On the transfer test, participants alternated between unpracticed 10{$^\circ$} and 80{$^\circ$} targets. Four blocks of practice trials were provided in each condition, with 20 movements made in each. Movements were more accurate and consistent during constant practice compared to variable practice, with the 20{$^\circ$}-70{$^\circ$} group having greater spatial errors compared to the 20{$^\circ$}-45{$^\circ$} group. Both groups performed equally well on the novel transfer test suggesting that adequate practice variability had been provided during acquisition.},

In this study, we questioned if pitching form determines the probabilistic structure of pitching errors in baseball pitchers. Eighteen collegiate baseball pitchers with various pitching forms including right- and left-handed overarm, sidearm and underarm throwers threw 100 pitches aiming at a target located 90 cm above the ground. Two dimensional distribution of pitch location was fitted by using bivariate normal distribution and 95\% confidence ellipse was calculated. In order to quantify the pitching form, the direction of the throwing arm trajectory in frontal plane was calculated. The direction of the long axis was dependent on each participant's pitching form (e.g., right overarm pitchers pitched along a right-up{\textendash}left-down ellipse and left overarm pitchers pitched along a left-up{\textendash}right-down ellipse). This was confirmed by circular correlation analysis (P = 0.98). These results suggest that different mechanisms, potentially errors in pitching mechanics and errors in ball release timing, might contribute to errors along the long axis and those along the short axis.},

The current work investigates this trade-off by comparing speaker variability effects on L2 vocabulary learning in different age groups. Existing literature suggests that speaker variability benefits L2 vocabulary learning in adults, but this may not be the case for younger learners. In this study native English-speaking adults, 7- to 8-year-olds, and 10- to 11-year-olds learned six novel Lithuanian words from a single speaker, and six from eight speakers. In line with previous research, adults showed better production of the multispeaker items at test. No such benefit was found for either group of children, either in production or comprehension. Children also had greater difficulties in processing multiple-speaker cues during training. We conclude that age-related capacity limitations may constrain the ability to utilize speaker variability when learning words in a new language.},

  abstract = {In cognitive modeling, data are often categorical observations taken over participants and items. Usually subsets of these observations are pooled and analyzed by a cognitive model assuming the category counts come from a multinomial distribution with the same model parameters underlying all observations. It is well known that if there are individual differences in participants and/or items, a model analysis of the pooled data may be quite misleading, and in such cases it may be appropriate to augment the cognitive model with parametric ran- dom effects assumptions. On the other hand, if random effects are incorporated into a cognitive model that is not needed, the resulting model may be more flexible than the multinomial model that assumes no heterogeneity, and this may lead to overfitting. This article presents Monte Carlo statistical tests for directly detecting individual participant and/or item heterogeneity that depend only on the data structure itself. These tests are based on the fact that heterogeneity in participants and/or items results in overdispersion of certain category count statistics. It is argued that the methods developed in the article should be applied to any set of participant},

Face{\textendash}name pairs were studied with video-recorded environmental contexts in the background, and after 5 practice trials, recall of names associated with faces was tested in the absence of the original video context cues. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3, five retrieval practice trials for a pair occurred either always with the original video context (constant context condition) or with a new context on each trial (varied context condition). Final recall was tested either on the same day (Experiments 3 and 4) or 2 days later (Experiments 1 and 2), and either the recall test context for each face was a new (never seen) video (Experiment 1) or there was no context shown at test (Experiments 2, 3, and 4). In the first 3 experiments, acquisition was better for the constant context condition, but on the final recall test, performance was better for pairs learned under varied context conditions. In Experiment 4, which used multiple study trials rather than multiple retrieval practices during acquisition, no differences were found between the constant and varied context conditions, either for acquisition or for final retention. The results show that acquisition trials given in varied contexts can result in decontextualized memories, but only when acquisition involves retrieval practice, rather than simple restudy trials. These results are consistent with the new theory of disuse, but not with the theory of encoding variability.},

Here we describe a direct comparison between visually guided searches (as studied in visual search tasks) and foraging that is not based upon a visually distinct target, within the same context. The experiment was conducted in a novel apparatus, where search locations were indicated by an array of lights embedded in the floor. In visually guided conditions participants searched for a target defined by the presence of a feature (red target amongst green distractors) or the absence of a feature (green target amongst red and green distractors). Despite the expanded search scale and the different response requirements, these conditions followed the pattern found in conventional visual search paradigms: feature-present search latencies were not linearly related to display size, whereas feature-absent searches were longer as the number of distractors increased. In a non-visually guided foraging condition, participants searched for a target that was only visible once the switch was activated. This resulted in far longer latencies that rose markedly with display size. Compared to eye-movements in previous visual search studies, there were few revisit errors to previously inspected locations in this condition. This demonstrates the important distinction between visually guided and non- visually guided foraging processes, and shows that the visual search paradigm is an equivocal model for general search in any context. We suggest a comprehensive model of human spatial search behaviour needs to include searchat a small and large scale as well as visually guided and non-visually guided search.},

The present paper addresses the question of how implicative relations are learned. We suggest that implicative relations are learned via error-driven predictive learning, a process that crucially relies on instances in which morphologically related forms are close together in time. Previous corpus research has shown that temporal proximity is characteristic of morphologically-related forms. We show that temporal contiguity between such forms, an extreme form of temporal proximity, improves learners' ability to acquire implicative relations between these forms. We then show that a simple predictive error-driven learning model (Rescorla \& Wagner, 1972) accounts for the full pattern of results very well. The model is further shown to account for the effects of contiguity only if contiguity highlights (increases the salience of) the differences and similarities between corresponding forms, providing a mechanistic account of how contiguity helps acquire paradigmatic mappings. In contrast, the influence of contiguity on increasing salience of the cues in the base as predictors of the derived form is relatively minor. The proposed model provides a mechanistic account for how implicative paradigmatic relations could be acquired from occasionally experiencing corresponding forms in close proximity.},

During the instruction or training process, however, what we can observe and measure is performance, which is often an unreliable index of whether the relatively long-term changes that constitute learning have taken place. The time-honored distinction between learning and performance dates back decades, spurred by early animal and motor-skills research that revealed that learning can occur even when no discernible changes in performance are observed. More recently, the converse has also been shown-specifically, that improvements in performance can fail to yield significant learning-and, in fact, that certain manipulations can have opposite effects on learning and performance. We review the extant literature in the motor- and verbal-learning domains that necessitates the distinction between learning and performance. In addition, we examine research in metacognition that suggests that people often mistakenly interpret their performance during acquisition as a reliable guide to long-term learning. These and other considerations suggest that the learning-performance distinction is critical and has vast practical and theoretical implications.},

Here, we test the novel hypothesis that humans adapt the degree to which they form absolute values to the diversity of the learning environment. Since absolute values generalize better to new sets of options, we predicted that the more options a person learns about the more likely they would be to form absolute values. To test this, we designed a multi-day learning experiment comprising twenty learning sessions in which subjects chose among pairs of images each associated with a different probability of reward. We assessed the degree to which subjects formed absolute values and relative preferences by asking them to choose between images they learned about in separate sessions. We found that concurrently learning about more images within a session enhanced absolute-value, and suppressed relative-preference, learning. Conversely, cumulatively pitting each image against a larger number of other images across multiple sessions did not impact the form of learning. These results show that the way humans encode preferences is adapted to the diversity of experiences offered by the immediate learning context.},

Participants memorized four items, and later recalled them using a continuous color or shape wheel. During study, participants articulated ``bababa'' or labeled the items with two, four, or their preferred term. Recall error decreased with increases in the number of labels. Mixture modeling showed that labeling increased the probability of recall. Memory precision, however, varied with categorical distinctiveness: broad labels reduced precision, whereas categorically distinct labels increased precision compared to no-labels.

  abstract = {Repeated forecasts of changing targets are a key aspect of many everyday tasks, from predicting the weather to financial markets. Random walks provide a particularly simple and informative case study, as new values represent random deviations from the preceding value only, with further previous points being irrelevant. Moreover, random walks often hold simple rational solutions in which predictions should repeat the most recent state, and hence replicate the properties of the target. In previous experiments, however, we have found that human forecasters do not adhere to this standard, showing systematic deviations from the properties of a random walk such as excessive volatility and extreme movements between subsequent predictions. We suggest that such deviations reflect general statistical signatures of human cognition displayed across multiple tasks, offering a window into underlying cognitive mechanisms. Using these deviations as new criteria, we here explore several cognitive models for predicting random walks drawn from various approaches developed in the existing literature, including Bayesian, error-based learning, autoregressive and sampling mechanisms. These models are contrasted to determine which best accounts for the particular statistical features displayed by experimental participants. We find support for sampling models in both aggregate and individual fits, suggesting that these variations are attributable to the use of inherently stochastic prediction systems. We thus argue that variability in predictions is driven by computational noise in the decision making process, rather than ``late'' noise at the output stage.},

We find that in both perceptual and cognitive tasks anchoring and repulsion co-occur, with the direction of the bias depending on the comparison value: distant values attract judgments, while nearby values repulse judgments. As none of the leading theories for either effect account for both biases, theoretical integration is needed. As a starting point, we describe one such integration based on sampling models of cognition.},

It remains unclear, however, how such experience is represented: numerical data can be processed by either a continuous analogue number system or a discrete symbolic number system, with each predicting different generalisation effects. The present paper therefore contrasts discrete and continuous prior formats within the domain of numerical estimation using both direct comparisons of computational models of this process using these representations, as well as empirical contrasts exploiting different predicted reactions of these formats to uncertainty via Occam's razor. Both computational and empirical results indicate that numeric estimates commonly rely on a continuous prior format, mirroring the analogue approximate number system, or `number sense'. This implies a general preference for the use of continuous numerical representations even where both stimuli and responses are discrete, with learners seemingly relying on innate number systems rather than the symbolic forms acquired in later life. There is however remaining uncertainty in these results regarding individual differences in the use of these systems, which we address in recommendations for future work.},

In the present article, we review different accounts on effects of errors in the previous trial (transient error effects) and overall error probabilities (sustained error effects) on behavioral adaptation. Based on this review, we derived five statistical models of how errors might influence voluntary task choices. We analyzed the data of three experiments in which participants voluntarily selected one of two tasks before each trial whereby task difficulty, and concomitantly error probability, increased successively for the selected/performed tasks. Model comparison suggested that choice behavior was best explained by a combination of error probability of the performed task, error probability of the alternative task, and whether the previous response was correct or incorrect. The results revealed that participants were most likely to switch tasks in situations where the error probability of the performed task was high, the error probability of the alternative task was low, and after an error on the previous trial. We conclude that task selection processes are influenced by transient and sustained error effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

In education literature, varied practice is listed as a positive intervention to improve acquisition of knowledge and motor skills. In the current study we tested the effectiveness of a varied practice intervention during laparoscopy training. Twentyfour trainees (control group) without prior experience received a 3 weeks laparoscopic skills training utilizing four basic and one advanced training task. Twenty-eight trainees (experimental group) received the same training with a random training task schedule, more frequent task switching and inverted viewing conditions on the four basic training tasks, but not the advanced task. Results showed inferior performance of the experimental group on the four basic laparoscopy tasks during training, at the end of training and at a 2 months retention session. We assume the inverted viewing conditions have led to the deterioration of learning in the experimental group because no significant differences were found between groups on the only task that had not been practiced under inverted viewing conditions; the advanced laparoscopic task. Potential moderating effects of inter-task similarity, task complexity, and trainee characteristics are discussed.},

Yet research points to two different work-design{\textendash}related strategies for accomplishing this goal: specialization to capture the benefits of repetition and variety (i.e., working on different tasks) to keep workers motivated and provide them opportunities to learn. In this paper, we investigate how these two strategies may bring different productivity benefits over time. For our empirical analyses, we use two and a half years of transaction data from a Japanese bank's home loan application-processing line. We find that over the course of a single day, specialization, as compared to variety, is related to improved worker productivity. However, when we examine workers' experience across a number of days, we find that variety helps improve worker productivity. Additionally, we show that part of this benefit results from workers' cumulative experience with changeovers. Our results highlight the need for organizations to transform specialization and variety into mutually reinforcing strategies rather than treating them as mutually exclusive. Overall, our paper identifies new ways to improve operational performance through the effective allocation of work.},

A sense of psychological safety may be one reason that team familiarity could aid in the process of team learning. In an experimental study, we find that familiar teams learn at a faster rate than unfamiliar teams. Additionally, we find that team familiarity leads to the development of psychological safety and that the relationship between team familiarity and team learning is mediated by psychological safety. By separately examining task variety, team familiarity, and psychological safety, our work offers new insights and direction for the study of learning in teams.},

From over 20,000 player record we identify 3475 players who have played on 50 or more days. Our focus is on how variability in elements of play affect subsequent skill development. After validating the persistent influence of differences in initial performance between players, we test how practice spacing, social play, play mode variability and a direct measure of game-world exploration affect learning rate. These latter two factors do not affect learning rate. Players who space their practice more learn faster, in line with our expectations, whereas players who coordinate more with other players learn slower, which contradicts our initial hypothesis. We conclude that not all forms of practice variety expedite skill acquisition. Online game telemetry is a rich domain for exploring theories of optimal skill acquisition.},

Learning-curve analysis allows learning rate, initial performance, and asymptotic performance to be separated out, and so can serve as a tool for reconciling the multiple factors that may affect learning. We review existing research on skill development using data from digital games, showing how such work can confirm, challenge, and extend existing claims about the psychology of expertise. Learning-curve analysis provides the foundation for direct experiments on the factors that affect skill development, which are necessary for a cross-domain cognitive theory of skill.

As evidence for this multiple-system hypothesis, researchers report a dissociation based on category-number manipulations in which rule-based category learning is worse when the category is composed of 4, rather than 2, response categories; however, informationintegration category learning is unaffected by category-number manipulations. We argue that within the reported category-number manipulations, there exists a critical confound: Perceptual clusters used to construct the categories are spread apart in the 4-category condition relative to the 2-category one. The present research shows that when this confound is eliminated, performance on information-integration category learning is worse for 4 categories than for 2 categories, and this finding is demonstrated across 2 different information-integration category structures. Furthermore, model-based analyses indicate that a single-system learning model accounts well for both the original findings and the updated experimental findings reported here.},

Lumosity is a web-based cognitive training platform that has grown to include over 600 million cognitive training task results from over 35 million individuals, comprising the largest existing dataset of human cognitive performance. As part of the Human Cognition Project, Lumosity's collaborative research program to understand the human mind, Lumos Labs researchers and external research collaborators have begun to explore this dataset in order uncover novel insights about the correlates of cognitive performance. This paper presents two preliminary demonstrations of some of the kinds of questions that can be examined with the dataset. The first example focuses on replicating known findings relating lifestyle factors to baseline cognitive performance in a demographically diverse, healthy population at a much larger scale than has previously been available. The second example examines a question that would likely be very difficult to study in laboratory-based and existing online experimental research approaches at a large scale: specifically, how learning ability for different types of cognitive tasks changes with age. We hope that these examples will provoke the imagination of researchers who are interested in collaborating to answer fundamental questions about human cognitive performance.},

Using a data set of 54 million gameplays from the online brain training site Lumosity, we show that learning functions of participants are systematically biased by participation policies that vary with age. Older adults who are poorer performers are more likely to drop out than older adults who perform well. Younger adults show no such effect. Using this knowledge, we can extrapolate group learning functions that correct for these age-related differences in dropout.},

  abstract = {Background Some psychopathologies, including those of anxiety and irritability, are associated with biases when judging ambiguous social stimuli. Interventions targeting these biases, or interpretation bias training, are amenable to computational modeling to describe their associative learning mechanisms. Here, we translate ALCOVE, a category learning modeling, to describe learning in youth with affective psychopathology when training on more positive judgments of ambiguous face emotions. Methods Seventy-one young people (ages 8-22 years) comprised a predominantly clinical sample to represent broad distributions of irritability and anxiety symptoms. Of these, sixty-three were included in the test sample, by completing an interpretation bias training task with acceptable performance for computational modeling. We used a separate sample of twenty-eight to translate ALCOVE for individual estimates of learning rate and generalization. In the test sample, we assessed associations between model learning estimates and irritability, anxiety, their shared variance (negative affectivity), and age. Results Age and affective symptoms were associated with category learning during interpretation bias training. Lower learning rates were associated with higher negative affectivity common to anxiety and irritability. Lower generalization, or improved discrimination between face emotions, was associated with increasing age. Conclusions This work demonstrates a functional consequence of age- and symptom-related learning during interpretation bias. ALCOVE measured learning also revealed learning types not accounted for in the prior literature on interpretation bias training. The work more broadly demonstrates the utility of measurement models for understanding trial-by-trial processes and identifying individual learning styles.},

We argue that they infer a novel option's reward from contextual information learned from functional relations and take uncertainty into account when making a decision. We propose a Bayesian optimization model to describe their learning and decision making. This model relies on similarity-based learning of functional relationships between features and rewards, and a choice rule that balances exploration and exploitation by combining predicted rewards and the uncertainty of these predictions. Our model makes 2 main predictions. First, decision makers who learn functional relationships will generalize based on the learned reward function, choosing novel options only if their predicted reward is high. Second, they will take uncertainty about the function into account, and prefer novel options that can reduce this uncertainty. We test these predictions in 3 preregistered experiments in which we examine participants' preferences for novel options using a feature-based multiarmed bandit task in which rewards are a noisy function of observable features. Our results reveal strong evidence for functional exploration and moderate evidence for uncertainty-guided exploration. However, whether or not participants chose a novel option also depended on their attention, as well as reflecting on the value of the options. These results advance our understanding of people's reactions in the face of novelty. Keywords: decision making, exploration-exploitation, function learning, novelty, reinforcement learning},

Notably, integrative strategies require knowing exact cue weights, whereas lexicographic heuristics can operate by merely knowing the importance order of cues. Here we study how using integrative or lexicographic strategies interacts with learning about cues. In our choice-learning-estimation paradigm people first make choices, learning about cues from the experienced qualities of chosen options, and then estimate qualities of new options. We developed delta-elimination (DE), a new lexicographic strategy that generalizes previous heuristics to any type of environment, and compared it to the integrative weighted-additive (WADD) strategy. Our results show that participants learned cue weights, regardless of whether the DE strategy or the WADD strategy described their choices the best. Still, there was an interaction between the adopted strategy and the cue weight learning process: the DE users learned cue weights slower than the WADD users. This work advances the study of lexicographic choice strategies, both empirically and theoretically, and deepens our understanding of strategy selection, in particular the interaction between the strategy used and learning the structure of the environment.},

  abstract = {This thesis consists of three studies investigating the strategy selection problem and the role of function learning in human decision making. Chapter 1 examines how people learn which decision strategy to use when facing multiple environments. It provides evidence that people associate different decision strategies to different types of environments through a trial-anderror type of process and learn to flexibly switch between the strategies as needed. Chapter 2 aims to identify the source of inter-individual differences in strategy adoption. It suggests that such differences can be traced back to how fast people learn the relationships between cues and the criterion they are trying to infer. Finally, Chapter 3 focuses on how people simultaneously learn functional relationships between cues and alternative rewards and make decisions. It provides evidence for interactions between function learning and decision processes and proposes a Bayesian optimization framework for understanding these interactions.

Lag constraints required that each path from apex to base of a computer-generated pyramid display differ from some number (the lag) of immediately prior paths. Location constraints specified end points at which paths must exit the pyramid. In all experiments, an early optimal period for acquiring a variability level was identified. Both low and high levels of variability were sustained during retention; high levels facilitated transfer. The results suggest that (a) early practice that requires high variability sensitizes learners to changes in condition and (b) such perception{\textendash}performance links facilitate transfer by activating appropriate alternative strategies/schema or initiating their construction.},

Sampling-based accounts of probability judgment have successfully explained such idiosyncrasies by assuming that people remember or simulate instances of events and base their judgments on sampled frequencies. Biases have been explained either by noise corrupting sample accumulation (the Probability Theory + Noise account), or as a Bayesian adjustment to the uncertainty implicit in small samples (the Bayesian sampler). While these two accounts closely mimic one another, here we show that they can be distinguished by a novel linear regression method that relates the variance of repeated judgments to their means. First, the efficacy of the method is confirmed by model recovery, and it more accurately recovers parameters than computationally complex methods. Second, the method is applied to both existing and new probability judgment data, which confirm that judgments are based on a small number of samples that are adjusted by a prior, as predicted by the Bayesian sampler.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that presenting novel words across various contexts (i.e., contextual diversity) helps to consolidate the meaning of these words both in adults and children. This effect has been typically explained in terms of semantic distinctiveness (e.g., Semantic Distinctiveness Model, Jones et al., Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology, 66(2), 115, 2012). However, the relative influence of other, non-semantic, elements of the context is still unclear. In this study, we examined whether incidental learning of new words in children was facilitated when the words were uttered by several individuals rather than when they were uttered by the same individual. In the learning phase, the to-be-learned words were presented through audible fables recorded either by the same voice (low diversity) or by different voices (high diversity). Subsequently, word learning was assessed through two orthographic and semantic integration tasks. Results showed that words uttered by different voices were learned better than those uttered by the same voice. Thus, the benefits of contextual diversity in word learning extend beyond semantic differences among contexts; they also benefit from perceptual differences among contexts.},

In this work, we pair a CNN with ALCOVE (Kruschke, 1992), a well-known exemplar model of categorization, and attempt to examine whether this model can reproduce the classic type ordering effect from Shepard, Hovland, and Jenkins (1961) on raw images rather than abstract features. We examine this question with a variety of CNN architectures and image datasets and compare ALCOVE-CNN to two other models that lacked certain key features of ALCOVE. We found that our ALCOVE-CNN model could reproduce the type ordering effect more often than the other models we tested, but in limited situations. Our results showed that success varied greatly across the various configurations we tested, suggesting that the feature representations from CNNs provide strong constraints in properly capturing this effect.},

  abstract = {The pattern of generalization following motor learning can provide a probe on the neural mechanisms underlying learning. For example, the breadth of generalization to untrained regions of space after visuomotor adaptation to targets in a restricted region of space has been attributed to the directional tuning properties of neurons in the motor system. Building on this idea, the effect of different types of perturbations on generalization (e.g., rotation vs. visual translation) have been attributed to the selection of differentially tuned populations. Overlooked in this discussion is consideration of how the context of the training environment may constrain generalization. Here, we explore the role of context by having participants learn a visuomotor rotation or a translational shift in two different contexts, one in which the array of targets were presented in a circular arrangement and the other in which they were presented in a rectilinear arrangement. The perturbation and environments were either consistent (e.g., rotation with circular arrangement) or inconsistent (e.g., rotation with rectilinear arrangement). The pattern of generalization across the workspace was much more dependent on the context of the environment than on the perturbation, with broad generalization for the rectilinear arrangement for both types of perturbations. Moreover, the generalization pattern for this context was evident, even when the perturbation was introduced in a gradual manner, precluding the use of an explicit strategy. We describe how current models of generalization might be modified to incorporate these results, building on the idea that context provides a strong bias for how the motor system infers the nature of the visuomotor perturbation and, in turn, how this information influences the pattern of generalization.},

  abstract = {Generalization provides a window into the representational changes that occur during motor learning. Neural network models have been integral in revealing how the neural representation constrains the extent of generalization. Specifically, two key features are thought to define the pattern of generalization. First, generalization is constrained by the properties of the underlying neural units; with directionally tuned units, the extent of generalization is limited by the width of the tuning functions. Second, error signals are used to update a sensorimotor map to align the desired and actual output, with a gradient-descent learning rule ensuring that the error produces changes in those units responsible for the error. In prior studies, task-specific effects in generalization have been attributed to differences in neural tuning functions. Here we ask whether differences in generalization functions may arise from task-specific error signals. We systematically varied visual error information in a visuomotor adaptation task and found that this manipulation led to qualitative differences in generalization. A neural network model suggests that these differences are the result of error feedback processing operating on a homogeneous and invariant set of tuning functions. Consistent with novel predictions derived from the model, increasing the number of training directions led to specific distortions of the generalization function. Taken together, the behavioral and modeling results offer a parsimonious account of generalization that is based on the utilization of feedback information to update a sensorimotor map with stable tuning functions.},

  abstract = {Categorization allows us to organize and extend our knowledge to make predictions about new things in the world. My dissertation presents series of experiments about how the statistical properties of stimuli incidental to a supervised classification task influence later learning. After exposure to task-incidental but statistically varying features, do people ``transfer in'' such knowledge to new problems where that information is suddenly applicable, or do they learn nothing at all in the first place such that they have nothing to transfer out of the first learning situation? What information about irrelevant features bias people when they move to another task where those features become relevant? The literature is unclear about how task-incidental features are used once they become relevant, and most studies use binary categories. Few studies present continuous features along integrated dimensions with many distributions. The findings suggest that participants represent the distribution task-relevant feature values differently than task-incidental feature values; they seem to represent the task-relevant feature distribution as consisting of two clusters and the task-incidental feature distribution as consisting of one cluster. Learners are faster and more accurate when the second task's category boundary is consistent with a trough in incidental feature distribution from the first task than when it is inconsistent, though this effect seems weak. These findings inform how we can structure environments and tasks to prepare people to learn without explicitly teaching them before the task.},

Theoretical arguments can motivate predictions for both rule use and exemplar use increasing with more practice. We describe a single large experiment (n = 190) that manipulated the number of training items (category size), the number of presentations of each training item, and the similarity between the training and the transfer stimuli in order to discover when rules and exemplars are most likely to be used. Results showed that rules and exemplars both influenced classification and that exemplars were used more often with smaller categories, with more training on items, and when test items were similar to training items. There was no consistent evidence of a shift from rule-based to exemplar-based categorization with more learning. Importantly, we found a number of conditions in which rules and exemplars were both used, even within individual participants. We discuss our results in terms of hybrid models of classification.},

  abstract = {Cognitive science has long shown interest in expertise, in part because prediction and control of expert development would have immense practical value. Most studies in this area investigate expertise by comparing experts with novices. The reliance on contrastive samples in studies of human expertise only yields deep insight into development where differences are important throughout skill acquisition. This reliance may be pernicious where the predictive importance of variables is not constant across levels of expertise. Before the development of sophisticated machine learning tools for data mining larger samples, and indeed, before such samples were available, it was difficult to test the implicit assumption of static variable importance in expertise development. To investigate if this reliance may have imposed critical restrictions on the understanding of complex skill development, we adopted an alternative method, the online acquisition of telemetry data from a common daily activity for many: video gaming. Using measures of cognitive-motor, attentional, and perceptual processing extracted from game data from 3360 Real-Time Strategy players at 7 different levels of expertise, we identified 12 variables relevant to expertise. We show that the static variable importance assumption is false - the predictive importance of these variables shifted as the levels of expertise increased - and, at least in our dataset, that a contrastive approach would have been misleading. The finding that variable importance is not static across levels of expertise suggests that large, diverse datasets of sustained cognitive-motor performance are crucial for an understanding of expertise in real-world contexts. We also identify plausible cognitive markers of expertise.},

The brain may control complex movements through flexible combination of motor primitives1, where each primitive is an element of computation in the sensorimotor map that transforms desired limb trajectories into motor commands. Theoretical studies have shown that a system's ability to learn action depends on the shape of its primitives2. Using a time-series analysis of error patterns, here we show that humans learn the dynamics of reaching movements through a flexible combination of primitives that have gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity. The wide tuning of the inferred primitives predicts limitations on the brain's ability to represent viscous dynamics. We find close agreement between the predicted limitations and the subjects' adaptation to new force fields. The mathematical properties of the derived primitives resemble the tuning curves of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The activity of these cells may encode primitives that underlie the learning of dynamics.},

Here, we demonstrate that the richness of motor training determines not only what we learn but how we learn. Human subjects made reaching movements while holding a robotic arm whose perturbing forces changed directions at the same rate, twice as fast, or four times as fast as the direction of movement, therefore exposing subjects to environments of increasing complexity across movement space. Subjects learned all three environments and learned the low- and medium-complexity environments equally well. We found that subjects lessened their movement-by-movement adaptation and narrowed the spatial extent of generalization to match the environmental complexity. This result demonstrated that people can rapidly reshape the transformation of sense into motor prediction to best learn a new movement task. We then modeled this adaptation using a neural network and found that, to mimic human behavior, the modeled neuronal tuning of movement space needed to narrow and reduce gain with increased environmental complexity. Prominent theories of neural computation have hypothesized that neuronal tuning of space, which determines generalization, should remained fixed during learning so that a combination of neuronal outputs can underlie adaptation simply and flexibly. Here, we challenge those theories with evidence that the neuronal tuning of movement space changed within minutes of training.},

  abstract = {Introduction Investigation of concept learning has focused predominantly on categorization, in which stimuli are associated with nominal response categories. More recently, however, concept learning research has begun to focus on function learning, in which continuously-valued stimuli are associated with continuously-valued responses. One particularly useful aspect of function learning is extrapolation - generating responses to novel stimulus values. Previous studies have found that regardless of training success, some participants extrapolate in accordance with the learned function whereas others do not (e.g., DeLosh, Busemeyer, \& McDaniel, 1997; Griego, 2001). Although models of function learning have gained some success in reproducing human extrapolation performance (e.g., DeLosh, et al., 1997), they have not yet been able to predict who will extrapolate. The purpose of this study was to determine if individual differences in extrapolation performance are related to problem solving in non-mathematical domains in order to gain a better understanding of the factors underlying function learning. Method Eleven undergraduate psychology students served as participants. They each completed a function learning phase of the experiment followed by a problem solving phase as described below.  Participants were first asked to learn the relationship between an organism's absorption of a newly discovered element, Zebon, and its release of another new element, Beros. During this training phase, participants were shown three vertical bars on a computer screen. The height of the first bar represented the amount of Zebon absorbed (input). The height of the second and third bars represented the predicted and actual amount of Beros released (output), respectively. Participants made their predictions by controlling the height of the second bar using the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard. The third bar was not revealed until participants made their predictions. Training consisted of 10 blocks of 20 trials. Training input values ranged from 81 to 119. Output values were determined by the mirror linear function: y=230-2.2x if x{$<$}100; y=2.2x-210 if x{$>$}100. An extrapolation phase followed, consisting of 30 novel input values outside of the training range, with no feedback.  Next, participants were asked to read and summarize two text passages (each an analog to Dunker's radiation problem, see Catrambone \& Holyoak, 1989). They were then asked to solve four matrix reasoning problems followed by Dunker's radiation problem. Results Extrapolation performance was assessed by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) across the 30 extrapolation trials for each participant. MAEs ranged from 12.87 to 53.80. Previous studies have used 30 as a cut-off for classifying participants as having abstracted the function or not. A multiple linear regression was performed using performance on the matrix reasoning problems and on Dunker's radiation problem to predict extrapolation performance. Together, performance on the matrix reasoning problems and Dunker radiation problem accounted for a significant proportion of the variability in extrapolation performance, R2 =.828, SEE=6.15, F(2,7)=16.84, p{$<$}.01. Inspection of the regression coefficients revealed that better performance on the matrix reasoning problems, but worse performance on Dunker's radiation problem, was associated with better extrapolation performance. Discussion Both extrapolation of the function and completion of the matrix reasoning problems required participants to induce a novel response that could only be generated by comparing multiple pieces of information. That is, successful extrapolation required use of more than just a single exemplar. Similarly, successful matrix reasoning requires consideration of all elements of the matrix. However, successful solution of the radiation problem could result from access to just a single analog. Thus, it is suggested that one factor that determines extrapolation is a tendency to process many sources of information in an analytic manner, rather than a tendency to look for a single similar exemplar (or at most a small number of exemplars).},

  abstract = {Flexibility in motor actions can be defined as variability in the use of degrees of freedom (e.g., joint angles in the arm) over repetitions while keeping performance (e.g., fingertip position) stabilized. We examined whether flexibility can be increased through enlarging the joint angle range during practice in a manual obstacle-avoidance target-pointing task. To establish differences in flexibility we partitioned the variability in joint angles over repetitions in variability within (GEV) and variability outside the solution space (NGEV). More GEV than NGEV reflects flexibility; when the ratio of the GEV and NGEV is higher, flexibility is higher. The pretest and posttest consisted of 30 repetitions of manual pointing to a target while moving over a 10 cm high obstacle. To enlarge the joint angle range during practice participants performed 600 target-pointing movements while moving over obstacles of different heights (5{\textendash}9 cm, 11{\textendash}15 cm). The results indicated that practicing movements over obstacles of different heights led participants to use enlarged range of joint angles compared to the range of joint angles used in movements over the 10 cm obstacle in the pretest. However, for each individual obstacle neither joint angle variance nor flexibility were higher during practice. We also did not find more flexibility after practice. In the posttest, joint angle variance was in fact smaller than before practice, primarily in GEV. The potential influences of learning effects and the task used that could underlie the results obtained are discussed. We conclude that with this specific type of practice in this specific task, enlarging the range of joint angles does not lead to more flexibility.},

  abstract = {Comparison and reminding have both been shown to support learning and transfer. Comparison is thought to support transfer because it allows learners to disregard non-matching features of superficially different episodes in order to abstract the essential structure of concepts. Remindings promote memory for the individual episodes and generalization because they prompt learners to retrieve earlier episodes during the encoding of later related episodes and to compare across episodes. Across three experiments, we compared the consequences of comparison and reminding on memory and transfer. Participants studied a sequence of related, but superficially different, proverb pairs. In the comparison condition, participants saw proverb pairs presented together and compared their meaning. In the reminding condition, participants viewed proverbs one at a time and retrieved any prior studied proverb that shared the same deep meaning as the current proverb. Experiment 1 revealed that participants in the reminding condition recalled more proverbs than those in the comparison condition. Experiment 2 showed that the mnemonic benefits of reminding persisted over a one-week retention interval. Finally, in Experiment 3, we examined the ability of participants to generalize their remembered information to new items in a task that required participants to identify unstudied proverbs that shared the same meaning as studied proverbs. Comparison led to worse discrimination between proverbs related to studied proverbs and proverbs unrelated to studied proverbs than reminding. Reminding supported better memory for individual instances and transfer to new situations than comparison.},

Such estimation techniques are crucial to the understanding of simulation-based models, whose likelihood functions may be difficult or even impossible to derive. One particular class of simulation-based models that have not yet benefited from the progression of Bayesian methods is the class of neurologicallyplausible models of choice response time, in particular the Leaky, Competing Accumulator (LCA) model and the Feed-Forward Inhibition (FFI) model. These models are unique because their architecture was designed to embody actual neuronal properties such as inhibition, leakage, and competition. Currently, these models have not been formally compared by way of principled statistics such as the Bayes factor. Here, we use a recently developed algorithm {\textendash} the probability density approximation method {\textendash} to fit these models to empirical data consisting of a classic speed accuracy trade-off manipulation. Using this approach, we find some discrepancies between an assortment of model fit statistics. For some participants, one model appears to be superior when one fit statistic is used, while another appears superior when a different statistic is used. However, for 13 of the 20 participants, one model wins by all of the fit metrics considered. The FFI wins in 5 of these cases, while the LCA wins, often by a wide margin, for the others.},

We show how under some conditions, models embodying instance representations can be consid- ered a special case of a strength-based representation. We discuss a number of mechanisms for producing adaptive behaviors in dynamic environments, and detail how they may be instantiated within ARM. To evaluate the rela- tive strengths of the proposed mechanisms, we construct a suite of 10 model variants, and fit them to single-trial choice response time data from three experiments. The first experiment involves dynamic shifts in the frequency of category exposure, the second experiment involves shifts in the means of the category distributions, and the third experiment involves shifts in both the mean and variance of the category distributions. We evaluate model performance by assessing model fit, penalized for complexity, at both the individual and aggregate levels. We show that the mechanisms of prediction error and lateral inhibition are strong contributors to the successes of the model variants considered here.

All of the models recalibrate judgments or mean judgments via a two-parameter calibration function, and differ in terms of whether (1) the calibration function is applied before or after the averaging, (2) averaging is done in probability or log-odds space, and (3) individual differences are captured via hierarchical modeling.

We then apply our method to two real-world examples to illustrate the types of complex problems our method solves. In the first example, we fit an error-correcting criterion model of signal detection, whose criterion dynamically adjusts after every trial. We then fit two models of choice response time to experimental data: the linear ballistic accumulator model, which has a known likelihood, and the leaky competing accumulator model, whose likelihood is intractable.

Both models embody neurologically plausible mechanisms such as ``leakage'', or the passive decay of evidence during a decision, and competition among alter- native through either lateral inhibition (in the LCA model) or feed-forward inhibition (in the FFI model). However, it remains unclear as to which dynamical sys- tem best accounts for empirical data, due to the limita- tions imposed by intractable likelihoods. Specifically, complexity measures that take into account posterior uncertainty and model complexity have yet to be applied. Our method of Bayesian analysis leads to results favoring the competitive mechanisms in the LCA over the feed- forward inhibition in the FFI, and reveals parameter trade-offs within these neurologically plausible models as well as interesting individual differences.},

  abstract = {This tutorial explains the foundation of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an approach to Bayesian inference that does not require the specification of a likelihood function, and hence that can be used to estimate posterior distributions of parameters for simulation-based models. We discuss briefly the philosophy of Bayesian inference and then present several algorithms for ABC. We then apply these algorithms in a number of examples. For most of these examples, the posterior distributions are known, and so we can compare the estimated posteriors derived from ABC to the true posteriors and verify that the algorithms recover the true posteriors accurately. We also consider a popular simulation-based model of recognition memory (REM) for which the true posteriors are unknown. We conclude with a number of recommendations for applying ABC methods to solve real-world problems.},

Two groups of 2-year-old children saw arrays of one novel and two known objects on a screen, and they heard a novel or known label. Stimuli were identical across conditions, with the exception that in the constant color condition objects appeared on a uniform white background, and in the variable color condition backgrounds were different, uniform colors. At test, only children in the variable condition showed evidence of retaining label-object associations. These data support findings from the adult memory literature, which suggest that variability supports learning by decontextualizing representations. We argue that these data are consistent with dynamic systems accounts of learning in which low-level entropy adds sufficient noise to the developmental system to precipitate a change in behavior.},

Understanding the mechanisms by which infants structure their own learning is therefore critical to our understanding of development. Here we propose an explicit mechanism for intrinsically motivated information selection that maximizes learning. We first present a neurocomputational model of infant visual category learning, capturing existing empirical data on the role of environmental complexity on learning. Next we ``set the model free'', allowing it to select its own stimuli based on a formalization of curiosity and three alternative selection mechanisms. We demonstrate that maximal learning emerges when the model is able to maximize stimulus novelty relative to its internal states, depending on the interaction across learning between the structure of the environment and the plasticity in the learner itself. We discuss the implications of this new curiosity mechanism for both existing computational models of reinforcement learning and for our understanding of this fundamental mechanism in early development.},

In the current study, we investigated whether learning about a category facilitates word learning (retention) by presenting 2-year-old children with multiple referent selection trials to the same object category. In Experiment 1, children either encountered the same exemplar repeatedly or encountered multiple exemplars across trials. All children did very well on the initial task, however, only children who encountered multiple exemplars retained these mappings after a short delay. Experiment 2 replicated and extended this finding by exploring the effect of within-category variability on children's word retention. Children either encountered narrow or broad exemplars across trials. Again, all children did very well on the initial task, however, only children who encountered narrow exemplars retained mappings after a short delay. Overall, these data offer strong evidence that providing children with the opportunity to compare across exemplars during fast mapping facilitates retention.},

Processes of abstraction allow the transfer of experiences and knowledge between contexts helping us make informed decisions in new or changing contexts. While we are often inclined to relate such reasoning capacities to individual minds and brains, they may in fact be contingent on human-specific modes of collaboration, dialogue, and shared attention. In an experimental study, we test the hypothesis that social interaction enhances cognitive processes of rule-induction, which in turn improves problem-solving performance. Through three sessions of increasing complexity, individuals and groups were presented with a problem-solving task requiring them to categorize a set of visual stimuli. To assess the character of participants' problem representations, after each training session, they were presented with a transfer task involving stimuli that differed in appearance, but shared relations among features with the training set. Besides, we compared participants' categorization behaviors to simulated agents relying on exemplar learning. We found that groups performed superior to individuals and agents in the training sessions and were more likely to correctly generalize their observations in the transfer phase, especially in the high complexity session, suggesting that groups more effectively induced underlying categorization rules from the stimuli than individuals and agents. Crucially, variation in performance among groups was predicted by semantic diversity in members' dialogical contributions, suggesting a link between social interaction, cognitive diversity, and abstraction.},

This research investigated whether incidental exposure contributes to building category knowledge by rendering people ?ready to learn??allowing them to rapidly capitalize on brief access to explicit teaching. Across five experiments (N = 438 adults), we found that incidental exposure did produce a ready-to-learn effect, even when learners showed no evidence of robust category learning during exposure. Importantly, this readiness to learn occurred only when categories possessed a rich structure in which many features were correlated within categories. These findings offer a window into how our everyday experiences may contribute to building category knowledge.},

The clear-cut rules and well-defined environment of chess provide a model for investigations of basic cognitive processes, such as perception, memory, and problem solving, while the precise rating system for the measurement of skill has enabled investigations of individual differences and expertise-related effects. In the present study, we focus on another appealing feature of chess{\textemdash}namely, the large archive databases associated with the game. The German national chess database presented in this study represents a fruitful ground for the investigation of multiple longitudinal research questions, since it collects the data of over 130,000 players and spans over 25~years. The German chess database collects the data of all players, including hobby players, and all tournaments played. This results in a rich and complete collection of the skill, age, and activity of the whole population of chess players in Germany. The database therefore complements the commonly used expertise approach in cognitive science by opening up new possibilities for the investigation of multiple factors that underlie expertise and skill acquisition. Since large datasets are not common in psychology, their introduction also raises the question of optimal and efficient statistical analysis. We offer the database for download and illustrate how it can be used by providing concrete examples and a step-by-step tutorial using different statistical analyses on a range of topics, including skill development over the lifetime, birth cohort effects, effects of activity and inactivity on skill, and gender differences.},

Fortunately, some people take part in particular activities and pastimes throughout their lives, and often these activities are systematically recorded. In this study, we use the wealth of data collected by the National Basketball Association to describe the aging curves of elite basketball players. We have developed a new approach rooted in the Bayesian tradition in order to understand the factors behind the development and deterioration of a complex motor skill. The new model uses Bayesian structural modeling to extract two latent factors, those of development and aging. The interaction of these factors provides insight into the rates of development and deterioration of skill over the course of a player's life. We show, for example, that elite athletes have different levels of decline in the later stages of their career, which is dependent on their skill acquisition phase. The model goes beyond description of the aging function, in that it can accommodate the aging curves of subgroups (e.g., different positions played in the game), as well as other relevant factors (e.g., the number of minutes on court per game) that might play a role in skill changes. The flexibility and general nature of the new model make it a perfect candidate for use across different domains in lifespan psychology.},

The advantage of this task is that it allows testing the effect of the two training protocols on transfer by separately analyzing accuracy of the task solution, speed of reaching the correct solution and time planning before beginning to solve the task. Participants were divided into two groups. The ``constant training'' group practiced the task for 10 consecutive trials with identical configuration in terms of the ``start'' and ``end'' peg; followed by an 11th trial with a new configuration of the task (i.e., transfer). The ``varied training'' group practiced for 10 consecutive trials with different configurations, followed by a new configuration. As predicted, the constant training group yielded a higher cost when transferring to a new configuration of the task compared with the varied training group. These findings support the notion that varied training leads to the development of a schematic representation of the task solution, thus transfer is facilitated. These results have important implications in terms of the optimal learning conditions for adults while coping with cognitive problem-solving tasks.},

  abstract = {Humans can learn and store multiple visuomotor mappings (dual-adaptation) when feedback for each is provided alternately. Moreover, learned context cues associated with each mapping can be used to switch between the stored mappings. However, little is known about the associative learning between cue and required visuomotor mapping, and how learning generalises to novel but similar conditions. To investigate these questions, participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while we manipulated the offset between visual feedback and movement end-points. The visual feedback was presented with horizontal offsets of different amounts, dependent on the targets shape. Participants thus needed to use different visuomotor mappings between target location and required motor response depending on the target shape in order to ``hit'' it. The target shapes were taken from a continuous set of shapes, morphed between spiky and circular shapes. After training we tested participants performance, without feedback, on different target shapes that had not been learned previously. We compared two hypotheses. First, we hypothesised that participants could (explicitly) extract the linear relationship between target shape and visuomotor mapping and generalise accordingly. Second, using previous findings of visuomotor learning, we developed a (implicit) Bayesian learning model that predicts generalisation that is more consistent with categorisation (i.e. use one mapping or the other). The experimental results show that, although learning the associations requires explicit awareness of the cues' role, participants apply the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that is most similar to the current one, consistent with the Bayesian learning model. Furthermore, the Bayesian learning model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the present results. In short, we found a good correspondence between the Bayesian learning model and the empirical results indicating that this model poses a possible mechanism for simultaneously learning multiple visuomotor mappings.},

The empirical foundation of the variability prediction is evaluated here on the basis of 63 relevant studies (mainly journal articles and dissertations), reporting 73 different experiments and covering 12 years of empirical research (from 1975 through 1987). Experiments with adult (n = 48) and with child subjects (n = 25) were distinguished. In the literature, it is often stated that solid empirical support is available for the hypothesis, especially with child subjects. From the review presented here, it was concluded that, firstly, about half of the experiments were factually not addressing the variability prediction, particularly because no learning was evident during practice. Secondly, only limited support favouring the prediction could be obtained from the remaining experiments. The variability prediction cannot, therefore, rest upon consistent supportive evidence, neither with adult nor with child subjects.},

We report an experiment in which participants learned to classify artificial stimuli at both levels of a nested hierarchy and displayed more accurate classification of these items at the lower level of the hierarchy than at the more general level. Some authors have suggested that exemplar models would have great difficulty accounting for this phenomenon, but we show that the ALCOVE exemplar model effectively captures the behavioral pattern arising in the experiment. Despite suggestions to the contrary, superior performance at the lower level of a nested hierarchy does not necessarily invalidate the class of exemplar models.},

  abstract = {Many everyday skills are learned by binding otherwise independent actions into a unified sequence of responses across days or weeks of practice. Here we looked at how the dynamics of action planning and response binding change across such long timescales. Subjects (N = 23) were trained on a bimanual version of the serial reaction time task (32-item sequence) for two weeks (10 days total). Response times and accuracy both showed improvement with time, but appeared to be learned at different rates. Changes in response speed across training were associated with dynamic changes in response time variability, with faster learners expanding their variability during the early training days and then contracting response variability late in training. Using a novel measure of response chunking, we found that individual responses became temporally correlated across trials and asymptoted to set sizes of approximately 7 bound responses at the end of the first week of training. Finally, we used a state-space model of the response planning process to look at how predictive (i.e., response anticipation) and error-corrective (i.e., post-error slowing) processes correlated with learning rates for speed, accuracy and chunking. This analysis yielded non-monotonic association patterns between the state-space model parameters and learning rates, suggesting that different parts of the response planning process are relevant at different stages of long-term learning. These findings highlight the dynamic modulation of response speed, variability, accuracy and chunking as multiple movements become bound together into a larger set of responses during sequence learning.},

The relationship between the amplitudes of the cursor movement and the mouse movement was exponential in Experiment 1 and logarithmic in Experiment 2 for two groups of participants, while it was linear for the control groups in both experiments. The results of both experiments indicate that participants adjusted well to the external transformation by developing an internal model that approximated the inverse of the external transformation. We introduce a method to determine the locus of the internal model. It indicates that the internal model works at a processing level that either preceded specification of movement amplitude, or had become part of movement amplitude specification. Limited awareness of the nonlinear mouse{\textendash}cursor relationship and the fact that a working-memory task had little effect on performance suggest that the internal model is modular and not dependent on high-level cognitive processes.},

In the current investigation, we examine, for the first time, the learning difficulty experienced by observers in classifying members belonging to these primitive ``modal concepts'' instantiated with sets of acoustic and visual stimuli. We report results from two categorization experiments that suggest the acquisition of acoustic and visual modal concepts is achieved by the same general cognitive mechanism. Additionally, we attempt to account for these results with two models of concept learning difficulty: the generalized invariance structure theory model (Vigo in Cognition 129(1):138{\textendash}162, 2013, Mathematical principles of human conceptual behavior, Routledge, New York, 2014) and the generalized context model (Nosofsky in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 10(1):104{\textendash}114, 1984, J Exp Psychol 115(1):39{\textendash}57, 1986).},

An R package, glba, has been developed to fit the LBA model using maximum likelihood estimation which is validated by means of a parameter recovery study. At sufficient sample sizes parameter recovery is good, whereas at smaller sample sizes there can be large bias in parameters. In a second simulation study, two methods for computing parameter standard errors are compared. The Hessian-based method is found to be adequate and is (much) faster than the alternative bootstrap method. The use of parameter standard errors in model selection and inference is illustrated in an example using data from an implicit learning experiment (Visser et al., , Mem. Cogn., 35, 1502). It is shown that typical implicit learning effects are captured by different parameters of the LBA model.},

However, recent studies have shown that this effect can reverse under certain conditions. We propose that a key variable for such ugliness-in-averageness effects is the category structure of the presented exemplars. When exemplars cluster into multiple subcategories, the global average should no longer reflect the underlying stimulus distributions, and will thereby become unattractive. In contrast, the subcategory averages (i.e., local averages) should better reflect the stimulus distributions, and become more attractive. In 3 studies, we presented participants with dot patterns belonging to 2 different subcategories. Importantly, across studies, we also manipulated the distinctiveness of the subcategories. We found that participants preferred the local averages over the global average when they first learned to classify the patterns into 2 different subcategories in a contrastive categorization paradigm (Experiment 1). Moreover, participants still preferred local averages when first classifying patterns into a single category (Experiment 2) or when not classifying patterns at all during incidental learning (Experiment 3), as long as the subcategories were sufficiently distinct. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we mapped our empirical results onto predictions generated by a well-known computational model of category learning (the Generalized Context Model [GCM]). Overall, our findings emphasize the key role of categorization for understanding the nature of preferences, including any effects that emerge from stimulus averaging.

We show that when categories follow a family resemblance structure, people are unaffected by the presence of additional features in learning. However, when categories are based on a single feature, they fall prey to the curse, and having additional irrelevant features hurts performance. We compare and contrast these results to three different computational models to show that a model with limited computational capacity best captures human performance across almost all of the conditions in both experiments.},

We found that a linear additive neuronal network model performed well regardless of task structure and amount of learning.

Experiments 1 and 2 show that this effect emerges in hierarchically structured domains when a negative observation from a different category is added to a positive observation. They also demonstrate that this is related to a specific kind of shift in the reasoner's hypothesis space. Experiment 3 shows that the effect depends on the assumptions that the reasoner makes about how inductive arguments are constructed. Non-monotonic reasoning occurs when people believe the facts were put together by a helpful communicator, but monotonicity is restored when they believe the observations were sampled randomly from the environment.},

Supporting this, across two studies, groups appeared more homogeneous when people lacked first-hand information from personal experience with a group, as well as when stereotypes were based on second-hand information from the media or other people. However, only second-hand information increased confidence about group members, as lacking first-hand information reduced confidence about what groups and group members were like.

These conditions differed in the number of presentations of each bird (repetitions) and the number of unique species from each family (variability). After study, participants made CLJs for each family and were then tested.

This assumption is infrequently carefully tested in data. We develop a statistically principled method to directly estimate the correlation between latent components of cognitive processing across tasks, contexts, and time. This method simultaneously estimates individual-participant parameters of a cognitive model at each testing occasion, group-level parameters representing across-participant parameter averages and variances, and across-task correlations. The approach provides a natural way to ``borrow'' strength across testing occasions, which can increase the precision of parameter estimates across all testing occasions. Two example applications demonstrate that the method is practical in standard designs. The examples, and a simulation study, also provide evidence about the reliability and validity of parameter estimates from the linear ballistic accumulator model. We conclude by highlighting the potential of the parameter-correlation method to provide an ``assumption-light'' tool for estimating the relatedness of cognitive processes across tasks, contexts, and time.},

The imposed visuomotor rotations in the adaptation and the following generalization were either the same or opposing each other. In the generalization phase, motor bias resulting from prior adaptation was observed, and it turned out to substantially depend on the property of the workspace. In Experiment 1 with a parallel workspace, preceding adaptation to the same rotation was more advantageous than adaptation to an opposing rotation. This observation was reversed in Experiment 2 with the symmetrical workspace: prior adaptation to an opposing rotation was more advantageous for the generalization than prior adaptation to the same rotation. Mechanisms possibly underlying the observed influence of the workspace configuration were discussed.},

In the first experiment, they provided drawings and descriptions of their initial imagined animal, another member of the same species, and a member of a different species. The majority of imagined creatures were structured by properties that are typical of animals on earth: bilateral symmetry, sensory receptors, and appendages. Subjects also allowed shape, appendages and sense receptors to vary often across species but rarely within species. In Experiment 2, subjects{$\prime$} creations were influenced by correlated attributes; those told that the animal was feathered were more likely to produce creatures with wings and beaks, and those told it lived in water and had scales were more likely to produce creatures with fins and gills relative to subjects who were told the animal was furry or who were given no specific features. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that many subjects approach the task by retrieving exemplars of known earth animals, but that instructions and task constraints can lead to greater use of broader knowledge frameworks. Experiment 5 revealed that the structuring found in college students{$\prime$} imagined animals also holds for extraterrestrials developed by science fiction writers. The results are consistent with the idea that similar structures and processes underlie creative and noncreative aspects of cognition, and are discussed in terms of the concept of structured imagination. That is, when subjects create a new member of a known category for an imaginary setting, their imagination is structured by a particular set of properties that are characteristic of that category.},

Other evaluations are done at the single-subject level, and so fail to benefit from the reduction of noise that data averaging or aggregation potentially provides. To overcome these weaknesses, we develop a general approach to modeling individual differences using families of cognitive models, where different groups of subjects are identified as having different psychological behavior. Separate models with separate parameterizations are applied to each group of subjects, and Bayesian model selection is used to determine the appropriate number of groups. We demonstrate the general approach in a concrete and detailed way using the ALCOVE model of category learning, and data from four previously analysed category learning experiments. Meaningful individual differences are found for three of the four experiments, and ALCOVE is able to account for this variation through psychologically interpretable differences in parameterization. The results highlight the potential of extending cognitive models to consider individual differences.},

Although previous theories have specified how observers learn to attend to relevant dimensions over time, those theories have largely remained silent about how attention should be allocated on a within-trial basis, which dimensions of information should be sampled, and how the temporal order of information sampling influences learning. Here, we use the adaptive attention representation model (AARM) to demonstrate that a common set of mechanisms can be used to specify: (a) How the distribution of attention is updated between trials over the course of learning and (b) how attention dynamically shifts among dimensions within a trial. We validate our proposed set of mechanisms by comparing AARM's predictions to observed behavior in four case studies, which collectively encompass different theoretical aspects of selective attention. We use both eye-tracking and choice response data to provide a stringent test of how attention and decision processes dynamically interact during category learning. Specifically, how does attention to selected stimulus dimensions gives rise to decision dynamics, and in turn, how do decision dynamics influence which dimensions are attended to via gaze fixations?

However, a design feature of the study's stop-signal task violates "context independence", an assumption critical to current non-parametric methods for estimating stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), a key measure of inhibitory ability in the study. This has led some experts to call for the task to be changed and for previously collected data to be used with caution. We present a formal cognitive process model, the BEESTS-ABCD model, that provides a mechanistic explanation for the impact of this design feature, describes key behavioral trends in the ABCD data, and allows biases in SSRT estimates resulting from context independence violations to be quantified. We use the model to demonstrate that, although nonparametric SSRT estimates generally preserve the rank ordering of participants' SSRT values, failing to account for context independence violations can lead to erroneous inferences in several realistic scenarios. Nonetheless, as the BEESTS-ABCD model can be used to accurately recover estimates of SSRT and other mechanistic parameters of interest from ABCD data, the impact of such violations can be effectively mitigated.},

  abstract = {Abstract           A consistent finding in sensorimotor adaptation is a persistent undershoot of full compensation, such that performance asymptotes with residual errors greater than seen at baseline. This behaviour has been attributed to limiting factors within the implicit adaptation system, which reaches a sub-optimal equilibrium between trial-by-trial learning and forgetting. However, recent research has suggested that allowing longer motor planning periods prior to movement eliminates these residual errors. The additional planning time allows required cognitive processes to be completed before movement onset, thus increasing accuracy. Here we looked to extend these findings by investigating the relationship between increased motor preparation time and the size of imposed visuomotor rotation (30{$^\circ$}, 45{$^\circ$} or 60{$^\circ$}), with regards to the final asymptotic level of adaptation. We found that restricting preparation time to 0.35 seconds impaired adaptation for moderate and larger rotations, resulting in larger residual errors compared to groups with additional preparation time. However, we found that even extended preparation time failed to eliminate persistent errors, regardless of magnitude of cursor rotation. Thus, the asymptote of adaptation was significantly less than the degree of imposed rotation, for all experimental groups. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between asymptotic error and implicit retention. These data suggest that a prolonged motor preparation period is insufficient to reliably achieve complete adaptation and therefore our results provide support for the proposal that the balance between error-based learning and forgetting (i.e., incomplete retention) contributes to asymptotic adaptation levels.},

To examine this question, we used a modified version of the chord learning task (Seibel, 1963) that entails producing simultaneous finger key presses, similar to playing a chord on a piano. In Experiment 1, difficulty, as indexed by response time (RT) to a particular chord on the first session, was held constant, and chords that were similar to other chords had longer RTs after practice than dissimilar chords. In Experiment 2, we used chords that produced different initial RTs to show that similarity affected asymptotic RT rather than the size of RT decrement achieved with practice. In Experiment 3, we eliminated differences in perceptual similarity by using Chinese characters for stimuli while retaining differences in motoric similarity, which resulted in nearly identical asymptotes for similar and dissimilar chords. Thus, the density effect observed in Experiments 1 and 2 appears to stem from competition triggered by similar stimuli. Because performance differences were immediately re-established when stimulus similarity was introduced in Experiment 3 during transfer sessions, competition appears to emerge among leamed, central representations that can be coactivated by multiple stimuli.},

Retrieval use during practice was lower for participants instructed to perform the task as accurately as possible than for participants instructed to perform the task as quickly as possible. The presence of novel items also reduced retrieval use. Of secondary interest, differential use of retrieval during practice had no significant effect on later performance during test.

They did not reliably outperform the specific group at 11ft, either. The numerically better performance at 11ft by the varied group was due, as it turned out in a subsequent experiment, to the fact that 11ft was closer to 9ft (one of the two training targets for the varied group) than to 7ft (the training target for the specific group).

  abstract = {How do scientists generate and weight candidate queries for hypothesis testing, and how does learning from observations or experimental data impact query selection? Field sciences offer a compelling context to ask these questions because query selection and adaptation involves consideration of the spatiotemporal arrangement of data, and therefore closely parallels classic search and foraging behavior. Here we conduct a novel simulated data foraging study{\textemdash}and a complementary real-world case study{\textemdash}to determine how spatiotemporal data collection decisions are made in field sciences, and how search is adapted in response to in-situ data. Expert geoscientists evaluated a hypothesis by collecting environmental data using a mobile robot. At any point, participants were able to stop the robot and change their search strategy or make a conclusion about the hypothesis. We identified spatiotemporal reasoning heuristics, to which scientists strongly anchored, displaying limited adaptation to new data. We analyzed two key decision factors: variable-space coverage, and fitting error to the hypothesis. We found that, despite varied search strategies, the majority of scientists made a conclusion as the fitting error converged. Scientists who made premature conclusions, due to insufficient variable-space coverage or before the fitting error stabilized, were more prone to incorrect conclusions. We found that novice undergraduates used the same heuristics as expert geoscientists in a simplified version of the scenario. We believe the findings from this study could be used to improve field science training in data foraging, and aid in the development of technologies to support data collection decisions.},

Much previous empirical work conceive of associative and analytical processes as two exclusive ways of addressing a judgment task, where only one process is selected and engaged at a time, in an either-or fashion. However, related work indicate that the processes are better understood as being in interplay and simultaneously engaged. Based on computational modeling and brain imaging of spontaneously adopted judgment strategies together with analyses of brain activity elicited in tasks where participants were explicitly instructed to perform similarity-based associative judgments or rule-based judgments (n = 74), we identified brain regions related to the two types of processes. We observed considerable overlap in activity patterns. The precuneus was activated for both types of judgments, and its activity predicted how well a similarity-based model fit the judgments. Activity in the superior frontal gyrus predicted the fit of a rule-based judgment model. The results suggest the precuneus as a key node for similarity-based judgments, engaged both when overt responses are guided by similarity-based and rule-based processes. These results are interpreted such that similarity-based processes are engaged in parallel to rule-based-processes, a finding with direct implications for cognitive theories of judgment.},

In some cases, training can cause novel events to appear more familiar or attractive than those actually experienced during training: the peak shift effect. This study examined whether individual differences in learning led to systematic patterns of generalization. Participants were trained to identify simulated birdsongs, and then tested on their ability to identify a target song presented among several similar songs that differed in pitch. Initial analysis showed that those attaining moderate proficiency at discriminating songs during training were more likely to shift than those performing poorly or proficiently. However, a neural network trained to output individuals' gradient dynamics using only performance during training as input found an additional set of training variables that predicted shift. Specifically, one subset of shifters had highly conservative response biases accompanied by very little change to perceptual sensitivity in training. These findings suggest that discrimination learning may only lead to generalization shifts in some individuals, and that all individuals who shift may not do so for the same reason.},

All subjects were given trials on a task which involved a linear ballistic arm movement. The length of the movement was defined as the distance between a start button and a hinged target, which was knocked over by the subject at the end of the response. During training subjects attempted to produce their movements in a time of 550 ms and were given knowledge of results regarding timing error after each trial. During transfer trials a 300 ms movement time was attempted and no knowledge of results was given. Context was defined by the number of different movement distances performed during training and transfer. Half of the subjects received training trials with a single distance (constant context) while the other half received an equal number of trials with each of three distances (varied context). During the transfer stage of the experiment, subjects either performed in the same movement distance context experienced during training (i.e., constant to constant; varied to varied) or in the opposite context (i.e., constant to varied; varied to constant). The results of the transfer analysis suggested that similariy of context between training and transfer phases of performance was not crucial to the accurate production of a novel closed-timing movement. Implications of the present results for recent theories of memory development are discussed.},

Using a within-subject design, participants searched for both spatially and conceptually correlated rewards in multi-armed bandit tasks. We use a Gaussian Process model combining generalization with an optimistic sampling strategy to capture human search decisions and judgments in both domains, and to simulate human-level performance when specified with participant parameter estimates.

Furthermore,children's motor recognition (movement evaluation) was examined, in addition to recall (movement production), since apparently no such studies had been done within the context of schema theory before. Eighty-eight girls and boys with a mean age of 11.3 years were tested on a throwing task. Three groups of subjects practised under variable conditions (different target distances and weights) that differed with regard to contextual interference and sequential organi,zation of task variations; another group received constant throwing practice. Following practice trials with knowledge of results, the four treatment groups and a control group without prior practice were required to produce and evaluate a novel response (novel target distance and weight) without vision and knowledge of results. The results supported the variability-ofpractice hypothesis, in that variable practice in general facilitated recall and recognition on the novel task. Furthermore, variable practice with the highest level of contextual interference (random order of tasks) produced most effective transfer performance, suggesting that the structure of ihe variable-practice session in fact plays a role with regard to the effectiveness of motor schema development. Contrary to the `organization hypothesis' (Gentile and Nacson, 1976) a hierarchical organization of movement variations was not more beneficial to schema formation than random practice.},

We proceeded to show that training can reshape the temporal structure of motor variability, aligning it with the trained task to improve learning.

We investigated this question with several four-armed bandit tasks manipulating (within subjects) expected reward, uncertainty, and time pressure (limited vs. unlimited). With limited time, people have less opportunity to perform costly computations, thus shifting the cost-benefit balance of different exploration strategies. Through behavioral, reinforcement learning (RL), reaction time (RT), and evidence accumulation analyses, we show that time pressure changes how people explore and respond to uncertainty. Specifically, participants reduced their uncertainty-directed exploration under time pressure, were less value-directed, and repeated choices more often. Since our analyses relate uncertainty to slower responses and dampened evidence accumulation (i.e., drift rates), this demonstrates a resource-rational shift towards simpler, lower-cost strategies under time pressure. These results shed light on how people adapt their exploration and decision-making strategies to externally imposed cognitive constraints.},

Previous works report mixed empirical results when extrapolating with neural networks: while feedforward neural networks, a.k.a. multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), do not extrapolate well in certain simple tasks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) -- structured networks with MLP modules -- have shown some success in more complex tasks. Working towards a theoretical explanation, we identify conditions under which MLPs and GNNs extrapolate well. First, we quantify the observation that ReLU MLPs quickly converge to linear functions along any direction from the origin, which implies that ReLU MLPs do not extrapolate most nonlinear functions. But, they can provably learn a linear target function when the training distribution is sufficiently "diverse". Second, in connection to analyzing the successes and limitations of GNNs, these results suggest a hypothesis for which we provide theoretical and empirical evidence: the success of GNNs in extrapolating algorithmic tasks to new data (e.g., larger graphs or edge weights) relies on encoding task-specific non-linearities in the architecture or features. Our theoretical analysis builds on a connection of over-parameterized networks to the neural tangent kernel. Empirically, our theory holds across different training settings.},

Our method learns forward and backward nonlinear mappings between an objective space in which the stimuli are defined by the standard feature vector representation and a subjective space in which the distance between a pair of stimuli corresponds to their perceived similarity. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real human behavioral datasets to assess the effectiveness of Yada. The results show that Yada outperforms several standard embedding and metric-learning algorithms, both in terms of likelihood and recovery error.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to investigate whether the isotropy bias (estimating one's own motor variance as an approximately circular distribution rather than a vertically elongated distribution) arises in tennis players for the estimation of the twodimensional variance for forehand strokes in tennis (Experiment 1), as well as the process underlying the isotropy bias (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, 31 tennis players were asked to estimate prospectively their distribution of ball landing positions. They were then instructed to hit 50 forehand strokes. We compared the eccentricity of the ellipse calculated from estimated and observed landing positions. Eccentricity was significantly smaller in the estimated ellipse than in the observed ellipse. We assumed that the isotropy bias for the estimated ellipse comes from the process of variance estimation. In Experiment 2, nine participants estimated the 95\% confidence interval of 300 dots. Eccentricity was significantly smaller in their estimated ellipses than it was in the ellipses for the dots, though the magnitude of bias decreased for the estimation of dots. These results suggest that the isotropy bias in tennis ball landing position includes the bias of recognizing landing position and the bias of estimating the ellipse confidence interval from the recognized landing position.},

The results of the experiments indicated that subjects had significant difficulty learning these categories when they were given a stan- dard classification learning task. In contrast, subjects were able to acquire the same categories when they were given an inference learning task, in which they learned the categories by predicting a missing feature of a stimulus given the category label and information about the other features. Finally,subjects who were allowed to compare stimuli during learning were able to learn the categories.

This effect is regarded as evidence against the exemplar model, such as GCM (Generalized Context Model) and favoring the rule model, such as GRT (i.e., the decision bound model). Although this effect has been found in conceptual category learning, it is not often observed in perceptual category learning. To figure out why the category variability effect is seldom reported in the past studies, we propose two hypotheses. First, due to sequence effect, the midpoint item would be classified as different categories, when following different items. When we combine these inconsistent responses for the midpoint item, no category variability effect occurs. Second, instead of the combination of sequence effect in different categorization conditions, the combination of different categorization strategies conceals the category variability effect. One experiment is conducted with single tones of different frequencies as stimuli. The collected data reveal sequence effect. However, the modeling results with the MAC model and the decision bound model support that the existence of individual differences is the reason for why no category variability effect occurs. Three groups are identified by their categorization strategy. Group 1 is rule user, placing the category boundary close to the low-variability category, hence inducing category variability effect. Group 2 takes the MAC strategy and classifies the midpoint item as different categories, depending on its preceding item. Group 3 classifies the midpoint item as the low-variability category, which is consistent with the prediction of the decision bound model as well as GCM. Nonetheless, our conclusion is that category variability effect can be found in perceptual category learning, but might be concealed by the averaged data.},

Perceptual laws such as Weber's law, for example, have been used to model the perception of correlation in scatterplots. While this thread of research has progressively refined the modeling of the perception of correlation in scatterplots, it remains unclear as to why such perception can be modeled using relatively simple functions, e.g., linear and log-linear. In this paper, we investigate a longstanding hypothesis that people use visual features in a chart as a proxy for statistical measures like correlation. For a given scatterplot, we extract 49 candidate visual features and evaluate which best align with existing models and participant judgments. The results support the hypothesis that people attend to a small number of visual features when discriminating correlation in scatterplots. We discuss how this result may account for prior conflicting findings, and how visual features provide a baseline for future model-based approaches in visualization evaluation and design.},

  abstract = {Developing expertise in any field usually requires acquisition of a wide range of skills. Most current studies on perceptual learning have focused on a single task and concluded that learning is quite specific to the trained task, and the ubiquitous individual differences reflect random fluctuations across subjects. Whether there exists a general learning ability that determines individual learning performance across multiple tasks remains largely unknown. In a large-scale perceptual learning study with a wide range of training tasks, we found that initial performance, task, and individual differences all contributed significantly to the learning rates across the tasks. Most importantly, we were able to extract both a task-specific but subject-invariant component of learning, that accounted for 38.6\% of the variance, and a subject-specific but task-invariant perceptual learning ability, that accounted for 36.8\% of the variance. The existence of a general perceptual learning ability across multiple tasks suggests that individual differences in perceptual learning are not ``noise''; rather, they reflect the variability of learning ability across individuals. These results could have important implications for selecting potential trainees in occupations that require perceptual expertise and designing better training protocols to improve the efficiency of clinical rehabilitation.},

However, when a function defines the stimuli by time points, we can call this type of function as time-varying function. Learning timevarying function would be different from learning other ones. Specifically, the correlation between successive stimuli should play an important role in learning such functions. In this study, three experiments were conducted with the correlations as positive high, negative high, and positive low. The results show people perform well when the correlation between successive stimuli is high, no matter whether it is positive or negative. Also, people have difficulty learning the time-varying function with a low correlation between successive stimuli. A simple two-layered neural network model is evident to be able to provide good accounts for the data of all experiments. These results suggest that learning time varying function is based on association between successive stimuli.},

Generalization research predominantly relies on descriptive statistics, assumes a single generalization mechanism, interprets generalization from mono-source data, and disregards individual differences. Unfortunately, such an approach fails to disentangle various mechanisms underlying generalization behaviour and can readily result in biased conclusions regarding generalization tendencies. Therefore, we combined a computational model with multi-source data to mechanistically investigate human generalization behaviour. By simultaneously modelling learning, perceptual and generalization data at the individual level, we revealed meaningful variations in how different mechanisms contribute to generalization behaviour. The current research suggests the need for revising the theoretical and analytic foundations in the field to shift the attention away from forecasting group-level generalization behaviour and toward understanding how such phenomena emerge at the individual level. This raises the question for future research whether a mechanism-specific differential diagnosis may be beneficial for generalization-related psychiatric disorders.},

In the standard version of the paradigm, observers are flooded with multiple presentations of the prototype and its low distortions during transfer. In a modified transfer condition, we instead present multiple instances of an arbitrary high distortion and low distortions of that high distortion. An extreme ``high-distortion enhancement effect'' is observed. Also, there is a flattening of the typicality gradient associated with the standard patterns (prototype, low distortions, and standard high distortions). The results provide dramatic evidence of the role of learning during transfer in this task and force a reevaluation of the dominant current interpretation of the steep typicality gradient.},

Despite the robust character of generalization, considerable variation in conditioned responding both between and within humans remains a challenge for contemporary generalization models. The current study aims to investigate the extent to which variation in behavior in a context of generalization can be attributed to differences in perception. We combined a fear conditioning and generalization procedure with a perceptual decision task in humans. We found that the failure to perceive a novel stimulus as different from the trained fear-evoking stimulus led to increased conditioned responding. Furthermore, perceptual errors yielded perceived stimulus-outcome contingencies that differed substantially from the objective contingencies. Final, the impact of a perceptual error was dependent upon these perceived contingencies. These findings suggest that generalization across a perceptual dimension is to a large extent driven by perceptual errors that directly affect behavior but also indirectly as they yield different learning experiences between individuals.},

Based on recent advances, we demonstrate that the inclusion of perceptual measures in generalization research may lead to a better understanding of both intra- and interindividual differences in generalization. We explore various ways through which perceptual variability can influence generalized responding. We investigate its impact on the ability to discriminate between stimuli and how similarity between stimuli may be variable, rather than fixed, because of it. Subsequently, we argue that perceptual variations can yield different learning experiences and that interindividual differences in generalized responding may be understood from this perspective. Finally, we point to the role of memory and decision-making within this context. Throughout this paper, we argue that accounting for perception in current generalization protocols will improve the precision of obtained generalization gradients and the ability to infer latent mechanisms. This can inspire future attempts to use generalization gradients as a (clinical) predictor or to relate them to individual traits and neural correlates and, ultimately, may lead to new theoretical and clinical insights.},

(1961). The stimuli were simple geometrical figures varying in the following three dimensions: color, shape, and size. In Experiment 1, we found moderate positive correlations between confidence and accuracy in task type II and weaker correlation in task type I and III. Moreover, the trend analysis in the backward learning curves revealed that there is a non-linear trend in accuracy for all three task types, but the same trend was observed in confidence for the task type I and II but not for task type III. In Experiment 2, we found that the feeling-of-warmth judgments (FOWs) showed moderate positive correlation with accuracy in all task types. Trend analysis revealed a similar non-linear component in accuracy and metacognitive judgments in task type II and III but not in task type I. Our results suggest that FOWs are a more sensitive measure of the progress of learning than confidence because FOWs capture global knowledge about the category structure, while confidence judgments are given at the level of an individual exemplar.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of variable practice in learning the header skill in soccer. Thirty nine young athletes aged 10-12 (M=11.6, SD=0.55) with a training experience of 2 years (M=1.75, SD=0.25) were randomly divided in two groups. The first experimental group (VPG, n=20) followed a training program planned and organized by variable method of practice while the second experimental group (SPG, n=19) followed a stable/constant practice method. Both methods aimed at learning of the header skill. The duration of the intervention was eight (8) weeks; three (3) times per week, for 20 min. Participants of both groups were measured before the intervention (pre-test), after eight weeks of intervention (post-test) and one week after the final test without having any practice at all of header skill (retention test). For the header skill evaluation the test of i-Soccer (http://www.playisoccer.com/header) was used. ANOVA repeated measures indicated that there was an interaction effect between measures and group. Analyzing the interaction for the repeated factor ``measure'', a significant effect for variable group but not for stable group in the header skill was revealed. The athletes of variable group benefited from variable practice and they shaped the motor schema of header skill. In conclusion, coaches and physical education teachers could use variable practice in the long term development of soccer's header skill, if they have as a goal for their athletes to perform the skill in game situations.},

  abstract = {Talker variability has been reported to facilitate generalization and retention of speech learning, but is also shown to place demands on cognitive resources. Our recent study provided evidence that phonetically-irrelevant acoustic variability in single-talker (ST) speech is sufficient to induce equivalent amounts of learning to the use of multipletalker (MT) training. This study is a follow-up contrasting MT versus ST training with varying degrees of temporal exaggeration to examine how cognitive measures of individual learners may influence the role of input variability in immediate learning and long-term retention. Native Chinese-speaking adults were trained on the English /i/-/ɪ/ contrast. We assessed the trainees' working memory and inhibition control before training. The two trained groups showed comparable long-term retention of training effects in terms of word identification performance and more native-like cue weighting in both perception and production regardless of talker variability condition. The results demonstrate the role of phonetically-irrelevant variability in robust speech learning and modulatory functions of nonlinguistic domain-general inhibitory control and working memory, highlighting the necessity to consider the interaction between input characteristics, task difficulty, and individual differences in cognitive abilities in assessing learning outcomes.},

  abstract = {We investigate a new type of decision under risk where{\textemdash}to succeed{\textemdash}participants must generalize their experience in one set of tasks to a novel set of tasks. We asked participants to trade distance for reward in a virtual minefield where each successive step incurred the same fixed probability of failure (referred to as hazard). With constant hazard, the probability of success (the survival function) decreases exponentially with path length. On each trial, participants chose between a shorter path with smaller reward and a longer (more dangerous) path with larger reward. They received feedback in 160 training trials: encountering a mine along their chosen path resulted in zero reward and successful completion of the path led to the reward associated with the path chosen. They then completed 600 no-feedback test trials with novel combinations of path length and rewards. To maximize expected gain, participants had to learn the correct exponential model in training and generalize it to the test conditions. We compared how participants discounted reward with increasing path length to the predictions of nine choice models including the correct exponential model. The choices of a majority of the participants were best accounted for by a model of the correct exponential form although with marked overestimation of the hazard rate. The decision-from-models paradigm differs from experience-based decision paradigms such as decision-from-sampling in the importance assigned to generalizing experience-based information to novel tasks. The task itself is representative of everyday tasks involving repeated decisions in stochastically invariant environments.},

  abstract = {Correlation judgments are at the core of belief formation. In previous studies of correlation judgment from 2D scatterplots, observers underestimate correlations, and display stronger underestimation biases when the scatterplot is shown in a landscape view than in a portrait view. Yet, it is unclear how these biases arise. Here, we propose that observers are Bayesian learners who perform ``mental regression'' using the observed data points in graph. Accordingly, judgment errors can arise from biased visual information sampling. We test our model's predictions with two eye-tracking experiments and find that the Bayesian learning model, applied to information obtained from visual fixation data, replicates classic behavioral findings. The model also predicts trial-level estimation biases at a high accuracy level. Our study shows how computational models trained on process-level data can shed light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying belief formation, and yield theory-driven practical implications for data visualization and statistical communication.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that the SNARC effect may not be exclusive for numbers and can be extended to other ordinal sequences (e.g., months or letters in the alphabet) as well. In this study, we tested the SNARC effect with a non-numerically ordered sequence: The Chinese notations for the color spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet). Chinese color word sequence reserves relatively weak ordinal information, because each element color in the sequence normally appears in non-sequential contexts, making it ideal to test the spatial organization of sequential information that was stored in the long-term memory. This study found a reliable SNARC-like effect for Chinese color words (deciding whether the presented color word was before or after the reference color word ``green''), suggesting that, without access to any quantitative information or exposure to any previous training, ordinal representation can still activate a sense of space. The results support that weak ordinal information without quantitative magnitude encoded in the long-term memory can activate spatial representation in a comparison task.},

We propose a computational modeling framework that can synthesize human-like generalization patterns in our task setting, and sheds light on how people may navigate the compositional space of possible causal functions and categories efficiently. Our modeling framework combines a causal function generator that makes use of agent and recipient objects' features and relations, and a Bayesian non-parametric inference process to govern the degree of similarity-based generalization. Our model has a natural "resource-rational" variant that outperforms a naive Bayesian account in describing participants, in particular reproducing a generalization-order effect and causal asymmetry observed in our behavioral experiments. We argue that this modeling framework provides a computationally plausible mechanism for real world causal generalization.},

  abstract = {Normative models of decision-making that optimally transform noisy (sensory) information into categorical decisions qualitatively mismatch human behavior. Indeed, leading computational models have only achieved high empirical corroboration by adding task-specific assumptions that deviate from normative principles. In response, we offer a Bayesian approach that implicitly produces a posterior distribution of possible answers (hypotheses) in response to sensory information. But we assume that the brain has no direct access to this posterior, but can only sample hypotheses according to their posterior probabilities. Accordingly, we argue that the primary problem of normative concern in decision-making is integrating stochastic hypotheses, rather than stochastic sensory information, to make categorical decisions. This implies that human response variability arises mainly from posterior sampling rather than sensory noise. Because human hypothesis generation is serially correlated, hypothesis samples will be autocorrelated. Guided by this new problem formulation, we develop a new process, the Autocorrelated Bayesian Sampler (ABS), which grounds autocorrelated hypothesis generation in a sophisticated sampling algorithm. The ABS provides a single mechanism that qualitatively explains many empirical effects of probability judgments, estimates, confidence intervals, choice, confidence judgments, response times, and their relationships. Our analysis demonstrates the unifying power of a perspective shift in the exploration of normative models. It also exemplifies the proposal that the ``Bayesian brain'' operates using samples not probabilities, and that variability in human behavior may primarily reflect computational rather than sensory noise.},

Twenty-four unskilled adult throwers learned to throw by practicing with a subset of balls that would only allow acquisition of the ability to perceive the affordance if hefting acts as a smart mechanism to provide access to a single information variable that specifies the affordance. Participants hefted 48 balls of different sizes and weights and judged throwability. Then, participants, assigned to one of four groups, practiced throwing (three groups with vision and one without) for a month using different subsets of balls. Finally, hefting and throwing were tested again with all the balls. The results showed: (1) inability to detect throwability before practice, (2) throwing improved with practice, and (3) participants learned to perceive the affordance, but only with visual feedback. These results indicated that the affordance is perceived using a smart mechanism acquired while learning to throw.},

The quality of the evidence depends not only on its strength (`signal') but critically on its reliability (`noise'), but the separate contribution of these quantities to the formation of confidence judgments has not been investigated before in the context of perceptual decisions. We studied subjective confidence reports in a multi-element perceptual task where evidence strength and reliability could be manipulated independently. Our results reveal a confidence paradox: confidence is higher for stimuli of lower reliability that are associated with a lower accuracy. We show that the subjects' overconfidence in trials with unreliable evidence is caused by a reduced sensitivity to stimulus variability. Our results bridge between the investigation of miss-attributions of confidence in behavioral economics and the domain of simple perceptual decisions amenable to neuroscience research.},
