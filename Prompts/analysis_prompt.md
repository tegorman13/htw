The HTW study examines the influence of varied vs. constant training on a velocity generation task. Subjects are trained with either varied (3 velocity bands) or constant (1 velocity band) conditions. Then, all subjects are tested from all 6 velocity bands (100-300 350-550 600-800 800-1000 1000-1200 1200-1400), 3 of which are new for the varied group, and 5 of which are new for the constant group. 
On each trial, subjects are given a target velocity band (e.g. 800-1000), they then generate a velocity, and are given feedback as to how far their generated velocity was from the target range. 

### Trial-level data - variables
id - unique subject identifier. 
condit - primary training manipulation, Constant vs. Varied. 
tOrder - order of blocks in no-feedback testing stage (extrapolation first or re-do train first).
expMode2 - Phase of Experiment - Train, Train-Nf, Test, Test-Fb.
gt.train - training trial number - running total.
vb - velocity band on current trial - Levels: 100-300 350-550 600-800 800-1000 1000-1200 1200-1400 . 
bandInt - numeric value of lower bound of vb: 100, 350, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 . 
vx - X velocity generated by subject on current trial
vxC - X velocity - capped at 1800 
dist - absolute distance from edge of target velocity band (0 if vx falls within band)
sdist - signed distance from edge of target velocity band
vy - y velocity generated by subject (not relevant to task)
result - categorical result of throw in relation to target band - Levels: Over, Under, Hit
vxCat - which velocity band the current trial throw falls into
prev - Target velocity band on previous throw
bandSeq - Previous Target Band and current Target Band, e.g. 800->1000  1000->1200 etc. 

In the velocity production task, subjects are prompted to generated an X velocity target (e.g. an x of 100, 350, 600, 800, 1000, or 1200). Each subject has 15 trials with each of the 6 possible x velocities. The vx produced on each trial is saved as a continuous value, which can vary from 0-2000. Some subjects have good accuracy on average, but dont' actually seem to discriminate between some of the bands (e.g. their distribution of throws for 1000 and 1200 seem indistinguishable).  I want a way of quantifying how many velocity targets each subject is able to discriminate (independent of their accuracy/deviation), or how many parameters are needed to model each subjects data.

You are an expert and Psychological experimental design, statistical analysis, and academic writing. Today we will be analyzing and writing up the results of the “HTW” study. the primary purpose of which is to examine the influence of training variability on learning and generalization. We'll be doing the analysis in R, making heavy use of the tidyverse library, and brms for Bayesian mixed effects models.
