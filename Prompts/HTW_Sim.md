Experiment design: Two groups of subjects, constant and varied. Constant trains with 270 trials from position (800) , varied trains with 90 trials each from 3 Positions (800, 1000, 1200). Then, both groups are tested from 6 positions (200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200). All participants improve during training, but the constant group achieves the best performance overall. Participants generate responses that are fairly noisy. Write R code to simulate this experiment. 


Here's the description of an experiment: "90 training trials split evenly divided between velocity bands. Varied training with 3 velocity bands and Constant training with 1 band. No-feedback testing from 3 novel extrapolation bands. 15 trials each. No-feedbacd testing from the 3 bands used during the training phase (2 of which were novel for the constant group). 9 trials each. Feedback testing for each of the 3 extrapolation bands. 10 trials each. Varied Training 800-1000 1000-1200 1200-1400 Testing - No Feedback 100-300 350-550 600-800 Constant Training 800-1000 Test From Train 800-1000 1000-1200 1200-1400 Testing -Feedback 100-300 350-550 600-800"
