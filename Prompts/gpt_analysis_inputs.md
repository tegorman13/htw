### HTW description
The HTW study examines the influence of varied vs. constant training on a velocity generation task. Subjects are trained with either varied (3 velocity bands) or constant (1 velocity band) conditions. Then, all subjects are tested from all 6 velocity bands (100-300 350-550 600-800 800-1000 1000-1200 1200-1400), 3 of which are new for the varied group, and 5 of which are new for the constant group. 
On each trial, subjects are given a target velocity band (e.g. 800-1000), they then generate a velocity, and are given feedback as to how far their generated velocity was from the target range. 

### Trial-level data - variables
id - unique subject identifier 
condit - primary training manipulation, Constant vs. Varied. 
tOrder - order of blocks in no-feedback testing stage (extrapolation first or re-do train first)
expMode2 - Phase of Experiment - Train, Train-Nf, Test, Test-Fb
gt.train - training trial number - running total 
vb - velocity band on current trial - Levels: 100-300 350-550 600-800 800-1000 1000-1200 1200-1400
bandInt - numeric value of lower bound of vb: 100, 350, 600, 800, 1000, 1200
vx - X velocity generated by subject on current trial 
vxC - X velocity - capped at 1800 
dist - absolute distance from edge of target velocity band (0 if vx falls within band)
sdist - signed distance from edge of target velocity band
vy - y velocity generated by subject (not relevant to task)
result - categorical result of throw in relation to target band - Levels: Over, Under, Hit
vxCat - which velocity band the current trial throw falls into
prev - Target velocity band on previous throw
bandSeq - Previous Target Band and current Target Band, e.g. 800->1000  1000->1200 etc. 










In the velocity production task, subjects are prompted to generated an X velocity target (e.g. an x of 100, 350, 600, 800, 1000, or 1200). Each subject has 15 trials with each of the 6 possible x velocities. The vx produced on each trial is saved as a continuous value, which can vary from 0-2000. Some subjects have good accuracy on average, but dont' actually seem to discriminate between some of the bands (e.g. their distribution of throws for 1000 and 1200 seem indistinguishable).  I want a way of quantifying how many velocity targets each subject is able to discriminate (independent of their accuracy/deviation), or how many parameters are needed to model each subjects data.

You are an expert and Psychological experiment design, statistical analyses, and academic writing. You have been recruited to work the "HTW" study analysis and writeup, the primary purpose of which is to examine the influence of training variability on learning and generalization. Here is a description of the HTW study: 647 participants engaged in a visuomotor extrapolation task named "Hit The Wall," where they launched projectiles to hit a target. Participants underwent training and testing stages. During training, participants were divided into two groups: varied training (3 velocity bands) and constant training (1 velocity band) across 90 trials. Additional 'no feedback' trials were interleaved during training. The testing stage consisted of three phases: 1) No-feedback testing with 3 novel extrapolation bands (15 trials each), 2) No-feedback testing from the 3 bands used during training (9 trials each), and 3) Feedback testing for each of the 3 extrapolation bands (10 trials each). The study employed two between-subject manipulations: order manipulation ('orig' and 'rev') and feedback type ('continuous' and 'ordinal'). Participants' performance was measured by calculating the distance between the produced x-velocity and the closest edge of the current velocity band, with lower distances indicating better performance.

# GPT-4 Summaries

Summary 1: In this study, 647 participants engaged in a visuomotor extrapolation task named "Hit The Wall," where they launched projectiles to hit a target. Participants underwent training and testing stages. During training, participants were divided into two groups: varied training (3 velocity bands) and constant training (1 velocity band) across 90 trials. Additional 'no feedback' trials were interleaved during training. The testing stage consisted of three phases: 1) No-feedback testing with 3 novel extrapolation bands (15 trials each), 2) No-feedback testing from the 3 bands used during training (9 trials each), and 3) Feedback testing for each of the 3 extrapolation bands (10 trials each). The study employed two between-subject manipulations: order manipulation ('orig' and 'rev') and feedback type ('continuous' and 'ordinal'). Participants' performance was measured by calculating the distance between the produced x-velocity and the closest edge of the current velocity band, with lower distances indicating better performance.

Summary 2: The study involved 647 participants performing a "Hit The Wall" visuomotor task, requiring them to launch projectiles at a target by adjusting velocities. In the training stage, participants were assigned to either varied training (3 velocity bands) or constant training (1 velocity band) groups and completed 90 trials; no-feedback trials were also interspersed. The testing stage had three parts: no-feedback testing with 3 new extrapolation bands (15 trials each), no-feedback testing from training bands (9 trials each), and feedback testing in 3 extrapolation bands (10 trials each). Performance was quantified by the distance of the x-velocity from the nearest edge of the velocity band. Two between-subjects manipulations were implemented: catOrder ('orig' trains on bands 800-1000, 1000-1200, and 1200-1400, 'rev' trains on 600-800, 350-550, and 100-300) and feedbackType ('continuous' and 'ordinal' feedback).

Candidate Summary 3: This study investigated the effect of varied vs. constant training conditions on visuomotor extrapolation performance. A total of 647 participants were involved in the initial experiment and follow-up studies. Participants engaged in a task named "Hit The Wall," where they launched a projectile to hit a rectangle on the screen within specific velocity bands. The training stage consisted of 90 trials with varied (3 bands) or constant (1 band) training and interleaved no-feedback tests. The testing stage included no-feedback tests from three novel and three training extrapolation bands and feedback tests for three extrapolation bands. The study considered the order of training bands (catOrder) and feedback types (continuous or ordinal). Participants' performance was measured by calculating the distance between the achieved x-velocity (vx) and the nearest edge of the target velocity band.

Candidate Summary 4: In the study, the effect of varied and constant training on extrapolation performance in a visuomotor task was examined using 647 participants. The "Hit The Wall" task required launching a projectile to hit a target with a specified force, focusing on the x-velocity component. During training, participants underwent 90 trials with either varied training across three velocity bands or constant training on one band, and interleaved testing without feedback. The testing stage included 15 no-feedback trials on novel bands, nine no-feedback trials on training bands, and 10 feedback trials on extrapolation bands. The order in which training bands were presented (original or reversed) and feedback type (continuous or ordinal) were manipulated between subjects.

Candidate Summary 5: This study assessed how varied and constant training conditions impacted extrapolation performance in a novel visuomotor task called "Hit The Wall". Participants (647 in total) were tasked to launch projectiles to hit targets, focusing on x-velocity. The training stage comprised 90 trials, where varied training involved three velocity bands and constant training involved one. An interleaved no-feedback testing occurred during training. The testing stage included no-feedback tests from three novel bands and training bands and feedback tests from extrapolation bands. Additionally, between-subject variables included the order of training bands (original or reversed) and the type of feedback (continuous or ordinal). Performance was evaluated based on the distance between achieved x-velocity and the target velocity band's closest edge.

# GPT APA Methods

## Method

### Participants

A total of 647 participants were included in the analysis after applying exclusion criteria. The initial experiment consisted of 196 participants, with 106 in the constant training condition and 90 in the varied training condition. Participant demographics such as age, gender, and education level are not provided (XXX). Additional experiments were conducted with minor manipulations, but the results were consistent with the initial experiment.

### Materials and Procedure

The "Hit The Wall" (HTW) visuomotor extrapolation task was developed to investigate the effects of varied and constant training conditions. In this task, participants were asked to launch a projectile so that it hit a rectangle at the far end of the screen with a specified velocity. The projectile had both x and y velocity components, but only the x-dimension was relevant for the task. On each trial, the vx and vy values produced by the participant were recorded. The distance between the vx value and the closest edge of the current velocity band was calculated, with lower distance values corresponding to better performance.

The experiment had a mixed design, with training conditions (constant vs. varied) and feedback type (continuous vs. ordinal) as between-subjects factors, and trial type (training, testing) as a within-subjects factor. The training stage consisted of 90 trials, with varied training participants exposed to 3 velocity bands and constant training participants exposed to 1 band. Interleaved no-feedback testing (train-Nf) occurred throughout the training stage.

The testing stage included three trial types: 1. No-feedback testing from 3 novel extrapolation bands (test-Nf), with 15 trials each. 2. No-feedback testing from the 3 bands used during the training phase (test-train-Nf), with 9 trials each. 3. Feedback testing for each of the 3 extrapolation bands (test-feedback), with 10 trials each.

A between-subjects order manipulation (catOrder) was also included, with two conditions: orig and rev. In the orig condition, constant subjects trained on the 800-1000 velocity band, while varied subjects trained on the 800-1000, 1000-1200, and 1200-1400 bands. In the rev condition, constant subjects trained on the 600-800 band, and varied subjects trained on the 600-800, 350-550, and 100-300 bands.

Finally, a feedback type between-subjects manipulation was implemented. Participants in the continuous condition received continuous feedback, while those in the ordinal condition received ordinal feedback.

The software or platform used for data collection, randomization procedures, specific exclusion criteria, practice or familiarization trials, details on vx and vy value manipulations, time constraints, and description of the feedback provided are not provided (XXX).

# Velocity Band Descriptions

In the context of the study described, a 'velocity band' refers to a range of velocities that the projectile can have in the "Hit The Wall" task. Specifically, it is a range of x-velocities (velocities in the horizontal direction) that the participants aim to achieve when launching the projectile.

The concept of a velocity band is similar to a range or interval. For example, a velocity band of 800-1000 would mean that the acceptable x-velocity of the projectile should be between 800 and 1000 units (the units might be pixels per second, meters per second, or any other relevant measurement of speed).

In the study, participants were trained to hit targets within specific velocity bands. The idea is to see how well they could learn to control the projectile's velocity to make it fall within the desired range and whether varied training (practicing with different velocity bands) or constant training (practicing with the same velocity band) influenced their ability to do this, especially in the context of extrapolation to novel velocity bands.

Even though the bands are all the same size (200 units), we already know that they are not equally difficult for humans, e.g. they become progressively harder for large velocities (i.e. 100-300 is the easiest band, and 1200-1400 is the most difficult).

# Band Metrics Ideas:

Hit Rate: Calculate the proportion of trials where the subject's launch velocity fell within the target velocity band. It is a simple measure indicating how often the subject succeeded in hitting within the band.

Mean Distance from Center of Band: For each trial, calculate the distance between the subject's launch velocity and the center of the velocity band. Then, average these distances across trials for each subject. This would give an indication of how centered their shots were within the band.

Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): Similar to the mean distance, but use the absolute values of the distances. This measures how close, on average, the subjects were to the center of the band regardless of direction.

Standard Deviation of Velocities: Calculate the standard deviation of the velocities achieved by each subject. This will give an indication of the consistency of the subject's performance.

Edge Bias: Analyze if the subject's launch velocities are closer to the edges of the velocity band compared to the center. It might be indicative of a strategy or cautious approach.

# Original Summary

Consider this study description, then propose a statistical analysis approach that can be conducted with R. The main interest of the study is on the difference between the varied and constant training conditions, but the effect of catOrder and feedbacktype will also need to be considered. \## Introduction In project 1, we applied model-based techniques to quantify and control for the similarity between training and testing experience, which in turn enabled us to account for the difference between varied and constant training via an extended version of a similarity based generalization model. In project 2, we will go a step further, implementing a full process model capable of both 1) producing novel responses and 2) modeling behavior in both the learning and testing stages of the experiment. Project 2 also places a greater emphasis on extrapolation performance following training - as varied training has often been purported to be particularly beneficial in such situations. Extrapolation has long been a focus of the literature on function learning [@brehmerHypothesesRelationsScaled1974; @carrollFunctionalLearningLearning1963]. Central questions of the function learning literature have included the relative difficulties of learning various functional forms (e.g. linear vs.bilinear vs. quadratic), and the relative effectiveness of rule-based vs. association-based exemplar models vs. various hybrid models [@bottNonmonotonicExtrapolationFunction2004; @deloshExtrapolationSineQua1997; @jonesActiveFunctionLearning2018; @kalishPopulationLinearExperts2004; @mcdanielConceptualBasisFunction2005; @mcdanielPredictingTransferPerformance2009]. However the issue of training variation has received surprisingly little attention in this area. \## Methods \## Participants Data was collected from 647 participants (after exclusions). The results shown below consider data from subjects in our initial experiment, which consisted of 196 participants (106 constant, 90 varied). The follow-up experiments entailed minor manipulations: 1) reversing the velocity bands that were trained on vs. novel during testing; 2) providing ordinal rather than numerical feedback during training (e.g. correct, too low, too high). The data from these subsequent experiments are largely consistently with our initial results shown below. \## Task We developed a novel visuomotor extrapolation task, termed the ["Hit The Wall" (HTW]{.underline}) task, wherein participants learned to launch a projectile such that it hit a rectangle at the far end of the screen with an appropriate amount of force (specified by the velocity band values). Although the projectile had both x and y velocity components, only the x-dimension was relevant for the task. On each trial, we record the vx and vy produced by the participant. We calculate the distance between the vx value and the closest edge of the current velocity band. Note that lower distance values correspond to better performance. \## Design (expMode in dataframe) \### training stage 1) train - 90 training trials split evenly divided between velocity bands. Varied training with 3 velocity bands and Constant training with 1 band. 2) train-Nf - interleaved no feedback testing that happens throughout training \### Testing Stage 1) No-feedback testing from 3 novel extrapolation bands. 15 trials each. (test-Nf) 2) No-feedbacd testing from the 3 bands used during the training phase (2 of which were novel for the constant group). 9 trials each. (test-train-Nf) 3) Feedback testing for each of the 3 extrapolation bands. 10 trials each. (test-feedback) The is also a between subjects order manipulation (catOrder). In the orig condition, constant subjects train on band 800-1000, and varied subjects train on bands 800-1000, 1000-1200, and 1200-1400. In the rev condition, constant subjects train on band 600-800, and varied subjects train on bands 600-800, 350-550, and 100-300. There is also the feedbackType between subjects manipulation. Subjects in the continuous condition receive condition feedback, and subjects in the ordinal condition receive ordinal feedback.
